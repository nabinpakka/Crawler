However, she realized that it was likely now or never.\n        \u201cI\u2019ve never been one of those people who just pick up and move and do adventurous things like that,\u201d Barto tells CNN Travel, before explaining that Italy, where she\u2019d briefly visited in the 1980s, was high on the list of countries she\u2019d like to live in.\n        \u201cSo I thought I\u2019m getting to that age, might as well try it out and see how it will work out for me.\u201d\n        In 2020, Barto began attending regular webinars hosted by A Home In Italy, a company that assists foreigners with buying property in the European country, to figure out whether such a move would even be feasible.\n        \u201cI put pencil to paper and saw that I could afford it, and it was going to be more affordable than living in the United States,\u201d she says.\n        \u201cBecause everything\u2019s more expensive there. When I put the numbers together, I saw I could live there more comfortably with my retirement and the inheritance that I have. And I thought, \u2018Well, why not?\u2019\u201d\n        In April 2021, Barto traveled to Italy to begin searching for a home. She viewed around six houses, before choosing a property just outside the village of Palombaro in the region of Abruzzo in southern Italy.\n        \u201cI found the house immediately,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I was only out here one time. I got lucky.\u201d\n        Barto agreed to buy the three-bedroom home, which came with around two and a half acres of land filled with around 200 olive trees, for 123,000 euros, which worked out to $123,000 as the conversion rate was $1 to the euro when the sale was completed in late 2021.\n        \u201cYou couldn\u2019t buy something [like that] in the United States for what I paid [for it],\u201d she says.\n        According to Barto, the company she\u2019d been working with took care of the paperwork, and she found the process pretty simple.\n        To qualify for the Elective Residency Visa, a long-stay permit for non-EU citizens who intend to take residence in Italy, she had to have medical insurance and provide various bank statements and financial information to prove that she had enough \u201cpassive\u201d income to support herself while living in the country.\n        Once everything was finalized, Barto started making plans for her big move to Italy.\n        \u201cIt was kind of surreal,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange feeling, packing up your life and moving over somewhere different. So I felt kind of sad but excited at the same time.\u201d\n        In October 2022, Barto returned to Italy to begin her new life.\n        \u201cMy younger sister and my ex-husband came with me and helped me get settled,\u201d she says, explaining that she and her former husband \u201cget on very well.\u201d\n        Barto says it didn\u2019t take her long to get used to life in Abruzzo, and the locals made her feel at ease straight away.\n        \u201cThey came over and greeted me with coffee and cake,\u201d she says.\n        However, Barto was initially very nervous about driving in the country.\n        \u201cItalians are very intimidating on the roads,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd of course, this is a mountainous area. So you have a lot of twisty turns, and mountain roads and little roads.\u201d\n        Thankfully, she\u2019s gotten used to this over time and says it\u2019s \u201cjust the norm,\u201d for her now.\n        \u201cI\u2019m real easy driving,\u201d she adds. \u201cI don\u2019t let anybody intimidate me. I figure well, they\u2019re gonna go around me eventually.\u201d\n        She\u2019s found life in Italy to be far more affordable than in the US, and says that most of her necessities work out less expensive.\n        While Italian residents don\u2019t pay property taxes on their main residence, non-resident property owners are required to pay a local property tax.\n        Barto is unsure whether she\u2019ll have to pay taxes on her home, but says she\u2019s confident that it will be less than what she was paying in Texas.\n        \u201cMy money goes a lot further here,\u201d she adds. \u201cGroceries are a lot cheaper here. You save a lot more money here, which I like.\u201d\n        Barto has also found that she\u2019s more adventurous in Italy, and spends much of her time exploring the country, relying on buses and trains to get her around.\n        \u201cYou can travel to different places on the train and the bus, which you just don\u2019t have in Texas,\u201d she says.\n        \u201cYou don\u2019t really have to get out and drive. You can park your car at the train station and jump on the train and be in Rome in three hours, or Venice in four or five.\u201d\n        When she was living in the US, Barto says she didn\u2019t really go very far and \u201csat around a lot.\u201d\n        \u201cBeing that I was retired, I wasn\u2019t really doing anything,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause you didn\u2019t really have a lot to do.\n        \u201cAnd it\u2019s so hot half the time in Texas in the summer, you can\u2019t really go out and do anything. \u201cHere, it forces you to get up. I\u2019ve always got something to do. And I find things to do.\u201d\n        Barto keeps tabs on what\u2019s happening back home through online newspapers and admits she\u2019s sometimes disheartened by what she reads.\n        \u201cCrime has gotten so crazy over there,\u201d she says. \u201cTexas has one of those open gun laws and there\u2019s just way too many angry people with guns. I don\u2019t miss that at all.\u201d\n        Although she hasn\u2019t been able to visit home since moving to Italy, Barto is planning to return to the US for the festive holidays.\n        She\u2019s very much looking forward to seeing her family, as well as visiting her old neighborhood and eating all of her favorite foods.\n        \u201cMexican, BBQ, Indian, one of my favorite hamburger restaurants, chicken fried steak, Chinese and a good thick steak, all things you can\u2019t get around here,\u201d she adds.\n        While she\u2019s picked up some Italian, Barto still finds the language difficult, and mainly relies on Google Translate when it comes to communicating with Italians.\n        \u201cIf I go to the bank, and I need to make a withdrawal, I\u2019ll type in, \u2018I would like to make a withdrawal\u2019\u201d she explains.\n        \u201cAnd, I\u2019ll sit there and practice in the car several times. So [that] when I get into the bank, I can tell them what I need. And they\u2019re pretty easy to understand.\u201d\n        Barto goes on to explain that she has the words written out in Italian in front of her whenever she needs to call her hairdresser to make an appointment and repeats them several times before dialing.\n        \u201cWhen they answer I\u2019ll just say it real quickly,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo I\u2019m getting it. It\u2019s funny because now when I make a hair appointment, they always laugh and say, \u2018Oh it\u2019s Barbara from Texas.\u2019\u201d\n        Barto says she\u2019s also struggled to get used to the fact that the local shops and restaurants are shut during the daytime.\n        \u201cIf you want to do anything, you\u2019ve got to either do it in the morning or you have to wait till after four,\u201d she says, adding that she sometimes finds herself caught short.\n        \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel like cooking in the United States or any other place, you can just get in the car and go get some fast food.\n        \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen around here. So you\u2019ve got to adjust to that.\u201d\n        After living in Italy for almost a year, Barto says she feels at home and hopes to remain in the country permanently.\n        \u201cIf I have any really big health issues that I can\u2019t have taken care of here, then I would go home,\u201d she says. \u201cBut for the most part, I\u2019m going to stay here.\u201d\n        Non-citizens with Italian residence can register with the Italian National Healthcare System to access Italian public healthcare, although an annual fee may be applicable depending on the circumstances.\n        Barto has met many other expats around the country since moving there almost a year ago and is often amazed by the amount of people who\u2019ve left their lives behind for Italy.\n        \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of single women that have done it, besides me,\u201d she says. \u201cYou talk to them, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve been here for 10 years,\u2019 and they\u2019ve all settled in really well.\n        \u201cIt [moving to a different country] helps you get out of your norm. To put your big girl panties on and try something different.\u201d\n        One of Barto\u2019s favorite things about her Italian home is the view from her balcony, which looks out at the Maiella mountains.\n        \u201cI really enjoy living here. I love getting out and looking at my balcony views,\u201d she says, stressing that this is something she never takes for granted.\n        \u201cI know a lot of people say that, but I really do. It\u2019s very different when you wake up in the morning.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018Wow,\u2019 every day. It\u2019s a different scene every morning.\u201d\n  An earlier version of this story included a photo that was misidentified as the village of Palombaro.

It was like, \u2018Do you want a new car? Or do you want to house in France?\u2019 And we decided we wanted a house in France.\u201d\n        They returned to California the following day as planned, taking some time to mull things over, before ultimately choosing to take the leap.\n        \u201cWe had to sort of do some soul searching,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cIt was like, if we do it, and it\u2019s a mistake, then so what?\n        \u201cBut if we don\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll always wonder what if. And that\u2019s what it really came down to. We were willing to take the risk.\u201d\n        When they asked the owner about the courtyard, they were told that it didn\u2019t come with the house, but she would \u201cthrow in a garden plot by the river.\u201d\n        \u201cThat sealed the deal for us,\u201d says Johnson.\n        After making their decision, they wrote to the homeowner to offer to buy the 800-year-old house, and received a reply by postcard accepting their offer.\n        \u201cJim called the notaire and asked what we needed to do,\u201d recalls Johnson. \u201cHe said the postcard would serve as our contract because the seller was a respected businesswoman and her word was good.\u201d\n        In October, Thaman flew back to France to sign the papers. The couple say they were thrilled by how simple the buying process was.\n        \u201cEverything went so smoothly,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cWe felt that it was really meant to be.\u201d\n        They married in April 2002 and were on a plane to France preparing to begin their new lives by June.\n        Once they\u2019d arrived in Cajarc, they quickly got to work on renovating their new home, breaking down the walls in order to open up the place.\n        \u201cA lot of these houses have little small rooms,\u201d explains Thaman. \u201cSo my first tool was a sledgehammer.\u201d\n        The couple had previously worked on a house together, so they had some renovating experience.\n        \u201cWe got a mattress to throw on the floor,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cWe felt like we were back in college or something.\u201d\n        They decided to color the walls \u201cthe old traditional way,\u201d using a mixture of clay dug from a hillside near their home, and lime.\n        Johnson found various used lighting fixtures for their home at sales, including a $80 chandelier that had apparently survived World War II.\n        They describe their first few years in Cajarc as \u201clike living in some sort of fantasy.\u201d\n        \u201cEven taking the garbage out was fun,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cLaundry was fun. I\u2019d hang the laundry and I\u2019d hear somebody playing squeeze box somewhere.\n        \u201cAnd we just felt like we were in a movie. It was very exciting. It was hard to explain to our friends back in the States.\u201d\n        The couple say they were \u201cimmediately accepted\u201d by the locals, who were \u201ccurious\u201d about them, particularly the younger people, who couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d left California for France.\n        \u201cWe were the first foreigners to move into our village,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cComing from California, we were like rock stars.\u201d\n        They found themselves being invited to \u201craves in the hill\u201d and various other parties around the town.\n        \u201cWe were in our 50s,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cAnd we were hanging out with people in their 20s.\n        \u201cAnd after a while we met their parents, who were more our age. But we met the parents through the kids.\u201d\n        According to the couple, many of their friends are the parents, or even grandparents of the younger locals who embraced them so warmly at the very beginning.\n        And many more friendships were made while they were sitting in their garden. In fact, they sometimes joke that they \u201cbought a garden by a river and it came with a house.\u201d\n        They fondly recall being \u201cadopted\u201d by their oldest neighbors, who would introduce them to everyone \u201cas their American kids.\u201d\n        \u201cThey [the locals] appreciated that we were doing something to a house that had been sitting there for eight years,\u201d adds Johnson.\n        \u201cThey were happy that we had taken the house on and were fixing it up.\u201d\n        They estimate that they\u2019ve spent somewhere between $10,000 to $12,000 on the renovations so far.\n        \u201cWe set it up that way, because frankly, we didn\u2019t want to have a lot of people coming and visiting us,\u201d admits Johnson.\n        The couple were inundated with visitors during their second year in the town, and although they enjoyed spending time with loved ones, having to \u201cplan around everybody else\u2019s vacations\u201d became something of a distraction.\n        \u201cAfter that, we really set limits on visitors,\u201d says Johnson, pointing out that they wanted to focus their energies on working on their home and integrating into the local community.\n        The couple have long-stay visas, which means they cannot stay in France for more than 180 days, and spend half of the year in California, where they have another house.\n        They stress that going back and forth between the two countries works well for them, and they love having their summers in France.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s just very active here in the summer,\u201d explains Johnson. \u201cAnd then in the winter, everything kind of shuts down.\u201d\n        During their winters in the US, they spend time with Thaman\u2019s children and grandchildren, and tend to any business related to their real estate investments.\n        \u201cI do enjoy the winters in California,\u201d adds Thaman. \u201cWe have a really nice house [there]. There are people I play music with and our life just works. We like having two different lives.\u201d\n        Both particularly love the simplicity of living in Cajarc, and say their worlds are much more carefree there.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t have a dishwasher,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cI don\u2019t have a clothes dryer.\n        \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of luxuries. We ride our bikes, have dinner parties, and swim in the river.\n        \u201cOur life here is super simple, and we like it. Then we go back to the States, and it\u2019s so much about money and acquisition, that it\u2019s kind of hard for us to really relate to people there.\u201d\n        Thaman shares this sentiment, explaining that he was struck by the difference between\u00a0the consumerism in California and the \u201crelative lack of it\u201d in Cajarc when they first began living there.\n        \u201cPeople buy things [in France] and hold on to them,\u201d he says.\n        Despite spending half of the year in France for over 20 years, Johnson admits that she still struggles with the language.\n        \u201cJim picks it up much easier,\u201d she says, explaining that she finds it tough to keep up with the conversation while at \u201ca big dinner party where there\u2019s a lot of cross talk.\u201d\n        \u201cI understand better than I can speak. It\u2019s still a challenge. But it\u2019s something that I get to continue to work on. It\u2019s coming.\u201d\n        In the years since they bought their home, more expats have moved in to the town.

It was like, \u2018Do you want a new car? Or do you want to house in France?\u2019 And we decided we wanted a house in France.\u201d\n        They returned to California the following day as planned, taking some time to mull things over, before ultimately choosing to take the leap.\n        \u201cWe had to sort of do some soul searching,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cIt was like, if we do it, and it\u2019s a mistake, then so what?\n        \u201cBut if we don\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll always wonder what if. And that\u2019s what it really came down to. We were willing to take the risk.\u201d\n        When they asked the owner about the courtyard, they were told that it didn\u2019t come with the house, but she would \u201cthrow in a garden plot by the river.\u201d\n        \u201cThat sealed the deal for us,\u201d says Johnson.\n        After making their decision, they wrote to the homeowner to offer to buy the 800-year-old house, and received a reply by postcard accepting their offer.\n        \u201cJim called the notaire and asked what we needed to do,\u201d recalls Johnson. \u201cHe said the postcard would serve as our contract because the seller was a respected businesswoman and her word was good.\u201d\n        In October, Thaman flew back to France to sign the papers. The couple say they were thrilled by how simple the buying process was.\n        \u201cEverything went so smoothly,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cWe felt that it was really meant to be.\u201d\n        They married in April 2002 and were on a plane to France preparing to begin their new lives by June.\n        Once they\u2019d arrived in Cajarc, they quickly got to work on renovating their new home, breaking down the walls in order to open up the place.\n        \u201cA lot of these houses have little small rooms,\u201d explains Thaman. \u201cSo my first tool was a sledgehammer.\u201d\n        The couple had previously worked on a house together, so they had some renovating experience.\n        \u201cWe got a mattress to throw on the floor,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cWe felt like we were back in college or something.\u201d\n        They decided to color the walls \u201cthe old traditional way,\u201d using a mixture of clay dug from a hillside near their home, and lime.\n        Johnson found various used lighting fixtures for their home at sales, including a $80 chandelier that had apparently survived World War II.\n        They describe their first few years in Cajarc as \u201clike living in some sort of fantasy.\u201d\n        \u201cEven taking the garbage out was fun,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cLaundry was fun. I\u2019d hang the laundry and I\u2019d hear somebody playing squeeze box somewhere.\n        \u201cAnd we just felt like we were in a movie. It was very exciting. It was hard to explain to our friends back in the States.\u201d\n        The couple say they were \u201cimmediately accepted\u201d by the locals, who were \u201ccurious\u201d about them, particularly the younger people, who couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d left California for France.\n        \u201cWe were the first foreigners to move into our village,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cComing from California, we were like rock stars.\u201d\n        They found themselves being invited to \u201craves in the hill\u201d and various other parties around the town.\n        \u201cWe were in our 50s,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cAnd we were hanging out with people in their 20s.\n        \u201cAnd after a while we met their parents, who were more our age. But we met the parents through the kids.\u201d\n        According to the couple, many of their friends are the parents, or even grandparents of the younger locals who embraced them so warmly at the very beginning.\n        And many more friendships were made while they were sitting in their garden. In fact, they sometimes joke that they \u201cbought a garden by a river and it came with a house.\u201d\n        They fondly recall being \u201cadopted\u201d by their oldest neighbors, who would introduce them to everyone \u201cas their American kids.\u201d\n        \u201cThey [the locals] appreciated that we were doing something to a house that had been sitting there for eight years,\u201d adds Johnson.\n        \u201cThey were happy that we had taken the house on and were fixing it up.\u201d\n        They estimate that they\u2019ve spent somewhere between $10,000 to $12,000 on the renovations so far.\n        \u201cWe set it up that way, because frankly, we didn\u2019t want to have a lot of people coming and visiting us,\u201d admits Johnson.\n        The couple were inundated with visitors during their second year in the town, and although they enjoyed spending time with loved ones, having to \u201cplan around everybody else\u2019s vacations\u201d became something of a distraction.\n        \u201cAfter that, we really set limits on visitors,\u201d says Johnson, pointing out that they wanted to focus their energies on working on their home and integrating into the local community.\n        The couple have long-stay visas, which means they cannot stay in France for more than 180 days, and spend half of the year in California, where they have another house.\n        They stress that going back and forth between the two countries works well for them, and they love having their summers in France.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s just very active here in the summer,\u201d explains Johnson. \u201cAnd then in the winter, everything kind of shuts down.\u201d\n        During their winters in the US, they spend time with Thaman\u2019s children and grandchildren, and tend to any business related to their real estate investments.\n        \u201cI do enjoy the winters in California,\u201d adds Thaman. \u201cWe have a really nice house [there]. There are people I play music with and our life just works. We like having two different lives.\u201d\n        Both particularly love the simplicity of living in Cajarc, and say their worlds are much more carefree there.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t have a dishwasher,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cI don\u2019t have a clothes dryer.\n        \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of luxuries. We ride our bikes, have dinner parties, and swim in the river.\n        \u201cOur life here is super simple, and we like it. Then we go back to the States, and it\u2019s so much about money and acquisition, that it\u2019s kind of hard for us to really relate to people there.\u201d\n        Thaman shares this sentiment, explaining that he was struck by the difference between\u00a0the consumerism in California and the \u201crelative lack of it\u201d in Cajarc when they first began living there.\n        \u201cPeople buy things [in France] and hold on to them,\u201d he says.\n        Despite spending half of the year in France for over 20 years, Johnson admits that she still struggles with the language.\n        \u201cJim picks it up much easier,\u201d she says, explaining that she finds it tough to keep up with the conversation while at \u201ca big dinner party where there\u2019s a lot of cross talk.\u201d\n        \u201cI understand better than I can speak. It\u2019s still a challenge. But it\u2019s something that I get to continue to work on. It\u2019s coming.\u201d\n        In the years since they bought their home, more expats have moved in to the town. However, the couple say that around 95% of their friends there are French.\n        \u201cWe\u2019re friendly with them [the other expats,] but we are not friends with them,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cBecause we\u2019re here to live in a French community, not in an expat community.\u201d\n        When fellow Americans ask them for advice about buying a property in France, they usually suggest that they rent a place in a village for a while before making the decision to buy, as it doesn\u2019t always work out so well.\n        \u201cWe were lucky,\u201d says Thaman. \u201cWe have met quite a few people that have just jumped into something and it hasn\u2019t worked.

And from March to June \u2013 whale migration season \u2013 lucky tourists may even catch a glimpse of behemoths like the blue whale and the fin whale, the two largest animals on the planet.\n        As well as migrating whales, the Azores also have resident cetaceans, including sperm whales and some dolphin species, which can be seen year-round. With nearly a third of the 94 known cetacean species in the world observed here, the archipelago consistently ranks as one of the best places on the planet to go whale watching.\n        But the centuries-old relationship between Azoreans and whales has not always been so harmonious,as Rui de Souza Martins, emeritus professor of Anthropology at the University of the Azores, explains.\n        \u201cThe archipelago was populated by settlers from mainland Portugal from the 15th century onwards,\u201d he says. \u201cThese early inhabitants, mostly farmers, limited themselves to harvesting the dead whales they found at sea or on the coast. The whale blubber was boiled down to make oil for lamps.\u201d \n        By the 18th century, the Azores\u2019 resident population of sperm whales was drawing attention from the United States. Whaling ships from Nantucket and New Bedford, Massachusetts, would make the roughly 2,300-mile voyage east to go hunting. In the age before the discovery of crude oil, the use of spermaceti (the waxy substance obtained from the head of a sperm whale) and whale oil (from blubber) for lighting and other purposes, made whaling a lucrative industry. \n        These factory-style ships would lower small wooden boats into the ocean for the hunt, then haul the dead animal onboard the larger ship for processing.\n        It wasn\u2019t only the whale carcasses that came onboard. The Americans recruited Azorean men at low pay, enticing them with the offer of residence in the US once they\u2019d worked a certain number of years on the ships. Many emigrated to Massachusetts with the whalers. \n        By the middle of the 19th century, some of those emigrants returned to the archipelago, bringing with them the knowledge of whale hunting and dedicated boat construction. They kicked off the local whaling industry, building seven-man hunting canoes and equipment. Soon, factories processing whale oil, meat and bones sprung up on the islands. \n        Whaling seems unspeakably cruel from a modern perspective, but back then it was a matter of survival. There were no other paying jobs in the islands. Many whalers \u2013 who were primarily farmhands working for rich landowners \u2013 didn\u2019t even know how to swim, but risked life and limb to provide for their families. \n        \u201cWhale hunting and the commercial processing of its derivatives was a much needed source of income for the locals,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Carlos Garcia, sociologist and anthropology researcher. The money earned from whaling was used to pay for groceries, children\u2019s education, and other necessities. Films like 1969\u2019s \u201cThe Last Whalers\u201d and the 2019 Netflix production \u201cThe Last Whalers of S\u00e3o Miguel,\u201d provide a glimpse into the difficult lives of the Azorean whalers.\n        However, it wasn\u2019t to last forever. After crude oil was discovered in 1859, the demand for whale oil decreased dramatically in the following decades. \n        Right until the industry\u2019s end, in 1987, the practices of Azorean whalers were different from the factory ships of the Americans. They continued to hunt in their small wooden boats with handmade weapons, killing only a small number of sperm whales. Counterparts in other countries used modern vessels and sophisticated harpoons, leading to the decimation of many whale species. \n        To address this drastic decline in populations, the International Whaling Commission issued a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982. Portugal supported the ban, which meant the Azores \u2013 an autonomous region of the country \u2013 also had to comply. Pressure from local and global conservation organizations led to the eventual end of whaling in the Azores. The last whale was said to have been killed in 1987 by some disgruntled whalers from Pico island. \n        The transition away from whaling gave birth to new industries and practices \u2013 with the impetus coming from outside. In 1990, French national Serge Viallele set up the first whale watching company in the archipelago, on Pico island. \n        \u201cViallele showed that it was possible to live off the whales without killing them,\u201d says Miguel Cravinho, co-owner of Terra Azul, a whale watching company based on S\u00e3o Miguel island. \u201cThe focus quickly shifted from whaling to eco-tourism, conservation and education.\u201d\n        Today\u2019s whale watching trips aren\u2019t just fun days out for tourists; they support research, with the data collected from each of the trips used by local scientists to study behaviors and migration patterns. It is, says Cravinho, an \u201ceducational approach to whale watching.\u201d\n        Nearly 20 whale watching companies currently operate across the Azores, following global best practices and guidelines issued by the International Whaling Commission (IWC), as well as local regulations. \n        Boats must follow whales at a maximum speed of 10 knots, can only approach from 90 degrees behind, and must stay 50 meters (164 feet) away from them \u2013 or three times that distance if there\u2019s a mother and calf.\n        Only three boats may hover near the whales at any time, for a maximum 15 minutes \u2013 and sailing through a pod is not allowed. \n        To keep disturbance to a minimum, most whale watching companies in the Azores use RIBs (rigid inflatable boats) to minimize noise and emissions. The number of whale watching boats is strictly limited by a license system, which issues a maximum number per island \u2013 or per zone for the smaller islands. Hilltop lookout points known as \u201cvigias,\u201d once used by the whalers to spot prey, are now used by whale watchers to direct boats to different areas, so they don\u2019t congregate near the same animals.\n        \u201cWe developed a new and dynamic culture in which the whale took center stage as a creature of ecological, scientific, heritage, and tourist value,\u201d de Souza Martins explains. Meanwhile, museums across the islands discuss the Azores\u2019 whaling history, and you\u2019ll still see traditional 40-feet whaling canoes repurposed for sailing and rowing, used annually in summer regattas.\n        In February 2023, the archipelago was recognized as a Whale Heritage Site by the World Cetacean Alliance, an accolade described as the \u201cgold standard for responsible whale watching\u201d by its honorary president, Jean-Michel Cousteau. It is the second site in Europe and only the sixth in the world to achieve the rating.\n        Whale Heritage Sites are places that have been judged to have achieved an \u201cenvironmentally, socially and economically sustainable balance\u201d between nature, the local community and what visitors expect from the place.\n        Destinations must have already have conducted research on the whale watching in their area, and must commit to further research, education and awareness \u2013 as well as staging cultural events that celebrate cetaceans.\n        With rising tourist numbers and the increasing popularity of whale watching tours, there are concerns about the pressures on whales and their behavior. In his paper on whale watching as eco-tourism, Lu\u00eds Silva, senior research fellow at the Centre for Research in Anthropology in Lisbon analyzed potential challenges posed by the whale watching industry, both to the animal and the local community \u2013 from stress for the whales to profits going to tour company owners rather than the wider community.  \n        For now, whale watching remains a major draw for visitors to the islands. \n        \u201cThe whale has had such a remarkable journey in the Azores,\u201d says Garcia.\n        \u201cOnce considered a sea monster, it later became a useful resource. Now, it is a symbol of our collective identity and universal value.\u201d\n  Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions.

Pressure from local and global conservation organizations led to the eventual end of whaling in the Azores. The last whale was said to have been killed in 1987 by some disgruntled whalers from Pico island. \n        The transition away from whaling gave birth to new industries and practices \u2013 with the impetus coming from outside. In 1990, French national Serge Viallele set up the first whale watching company in the archipelago, on Pico island. \n        \u201cViallele showed that it was possible to live off the whales without killing them,\u201d says Miguel Cravinho, co-owner of Terra Azul, a whale watching company based on S\u00e3o Miguel island. \u201cThe focus quickly shifted from whaling to eco-tourism, conservation and education.\u201d\n        Today\u2019s whale watching trips aren\u2019t just fun days out for tourists; they support research, with the data collected from each of the trips used by local scientists to study behaviors and migration patterns. It is, says Cravinho, an \u201ceducational approach to whale watching.\u201d\n        Nearly 20 whale watching companies currently operate across the Azores, following global best practices and guidelines issued by the International Whaling Commission (IWC), as well as local regulations. \n        Boats must follow whales at a maximum speed of 10 knots, can only approach from 90 degrees behind, and must stay 50 meters (164 feet) away from them \u2013 or three times that distance if there\u2019s a mother and calf.\n        Only three boats may hover near the whales at any time, for a maximum 15 minutes \u2013 and sailing through a pod is not allowed. \n        To keep disturbance to a minimum, most whale watching companies in the Azores use RIBs (rigid inflatable boats) to minimize noise and emissions. The number of whale watching boats is strictly limited by a license system, which issues a maximum number per island \u2013 or per zone for the smaller islands. Hilltop lookout points known as \u201cvigias,\u201d once used by the whalers to spot prey, are now used by whale watchers to direct boats to different areas, so they don\u2019t congregate near the same animals.\n        \u201cWe developed a new and dynamic culture in which the whale took center stage as a creature of ecological, scientific, heritage, and tourist value,\u201d de Souza Martins explains. Meanwhile, museums across the islands discuss the Azores\u2019 whaling history, and you\u2019ll still see traditional 40-feet whaling canoes repurposed for sailing and rowing, used annually in summer regattas.\n        In February 2023, the archipelago was recognized as a Whale Heritage Site by the World Cetacean Alliance, an accolade described as the \u201cgold standard for responsible whale watching\u201d by its honorary president, Jean-Michel Cousteau. It is the second site in Europe and only the sixth in the world to achieve the rating.\n        Whale Heritage Sites are places that have been judged to have achieved an \u201cenvironmentally, socially and economically sustainable balance\u201d between nature, the local community and what visitors expect from the place.\n        Destinations must have already have conducted research on the whale watching in their area, and must commit to further research, education and awareness \u2013 as well as staging cultural events that celebrate cetaceans.\n        With rising tourist numbers and the increasing popularity of whale watching tours, there are concerns about the pressures on whales and their behavior. In his paper on whale watching as eco-tourism, Lu\u00eds Silva, senior research fellow at the Centre for Research in Anthropology in Lisbon analyzed potential challenges posed by the whale watching industry, both to the animal and the local community \u2013 from stress for the whales to profits going to tour company owners rather than the wider community.  \n        For now, whale watching remains a major draw for visitors to the islands. \n        \u201cThe whale has had such a remarkable journey in the Azores,\u201d says Garcia.\n        \u201cOnce considered a sea monster, it later became a useful resource. Now, it is a symbol of our collective identity and universal value.\u201d\n  Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions.

He would later win the Pritzker Prize, which is considered the Nobel of architecture.\n        There\u2019s much more to the Opera House than, well, opera.\n        \u201cI think there\u2019s a big misconception that we\u2019re the classical arts,\u201d says Jade McKellar, chief customer officer for the Sydney Opera House.\n        \u201cWe also have contemporary music. We have a big talks program, where we\u2019ve had international and local speakers take it to our stages. We have children\u2019s programming. Any time you come to the Opera House, there\u2019ll be something on that somebody would be interested in.\u201d\n        When UNESCO added the Opera House to its World Heritage list in 2007, the praise was euphoric.\n        \u201cThe Sydney Opera House constitutes a masterpiece of 20th Century architecture,\u201d UNESCO wrote in its designation.\n        The document cited the building\u2019s \u201cunparalleled design and construction\u201d and called it \u201ca daring and visionary experiment.\u201d\n        All of these accolades might feel intimidating to a visitor. But McKellar says that the Opera House has spent years trying to open up its offerings to as wide an audience as possible.\n        That means putting Opera House programming online for more people to watch, for example. But it also means providing Opera House tours in a range of languages \u2013 from Spanish to Korean \u2013 in order to better serve international audiences, and it means having dedicated staff and programming to highlight the First Nations community.\n        Before Sydney or the Opera House existed, this piece of land was named Tubowgule by the native Gadigal people.\n        The Opera House\u2019s fine dining restaurant, Bennelong, gets its name from the Gadigal word for the Sydney harbor area, and Aboriginal artist Megan Cope made a site-specific artwork, \u201cWhispers,\u201d out of poles and oyster shells for the 50th anniversary celebrations.\n        Ultimately, McKellar says, the goal of the Opera House is to be a \u201cpeople\u2019s house,\u201d where all Australians are welcome.\n        While plenty of tourists visit the opera house to attend shows, have a meal at one of the restaurants inside the building, or just take a guided tour, the team behind the house also wants local Sydneysiders to feel like they can swing by anytime.\n        McKellar, a Sydney native, says that ethos very much mirrors her own experience. She first visited as a child, performing in a choir production of \u201cThe Pied Piper of Hamelin.\u201d As an adult, she brought out-of-town colleagues over to Opera Bar for drinks and eventually she even got married there, in one of the building\u2019s function rooms.\n        For many, tourist attractions like the opera house are once-in-a-lifetime destinations. But if there was a UNESCO World Heritage site in your neighborhood, would you go more often?\n        According to data from the Opera House, 42% of people who bought a ticket for an event or program in 2022 were first-timers.\n        In addition, viewers consumed 790,000 hours of Opera House content on YouTube.\n        For McKellar and her team, those numbers point to the fact that the Opera House is more than just a building \u2013 it\u2019s a community hub.\n        \u201cWe want everyone to think about, \u2018What am I going to do this weekend? I\u2019m going to go to the opera house, because there\u2019s something for me. I feel like I\u2019m welcome there. I see myself there.

The popular Tokyo-Osaka bullet train is rolling back its on-train\u00a0snack cart service,\u00a0which means passengers may want to BYOR \u2013 bring your own ramen.\n        It\u2019s not only bullet trains that just got pricier. One of Japan\u2019s most iconic attractions began charging a visitor fee this week for the first time in its history.\n        The Itsukushima shrine outside of Hiroshima, whose bright orange torii gate looks like it\u2019s floating in a lake, was one of President Joe Biden\u2019s stops on his recent visit to Japan. Looks like he squeaked by just in time \u2013 on October 1, the island began charging fees of 100 yen (for a single visit) or 300 yen (for multiples), citing crowd control issues. 100 yen is about 67 US cents.\n        Overtourism is a growing concern around Japan, which only fully reopened to tourists last fall.\n        As CNN\u2019s Emiko Jozuka reports, Mount Fuji has been suffering from the impact of too many visitors. See how local volunteers are helping to keep the country\u2019s most recognizable symbol in good shape for generations to come.\n        The biggest misconception about food from Sri Lanka? That it\u2019s the same food as next-door neighbor India.\n        Now, a group of young Sri Lankan chefs are taking their cuisine around the world. From egg hoppers in London to creamy coconut rice in Kentucky, the diverse flavors of Sri Lanka are finally getting their due.\n        \u201cI try to honor the recipes passed down to me and introduce flavors to diners that appear unexpectedly,\u201d says Sri Lankan-American chef Sam Fore.\n        More than 140 years after ground broke on Barcelona\u2019s Sagrada Familia, the end is finally in sight.\n        The basilica, despite being still under construction, is hugely popular with tourists and was named TripAdvisor\u2019s top attraction in 2022.\n        The fifth central tower was completed this week, with the sixth due to be finished in 2026 as the last piece of a complex design by Catalan architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed.\n        Though it may seem like the church took ages to complete, the construction process is quite fast if you consider it was only granted a building permit in 2019.\n        Believe it or not, it is possible to organize a group trip without everybody hating each other by the end.\n        The more you plan ahead of time, the more you\u2019ll actually enjoy your vacation. That means talking honestly about budgets and expectations, letting everyone play to their strengths, and being cool with it when somebody needs an afternoon to themselves.\n        When you get home, print out some of your favorite vacation pics and turn them into gifts for the rest of the crew so you\u2019ll all remember the good times.\n  India is mulling a ban on pilots and flight attendants wearing perfume.      But it\u2019s not because of the scent.\n  Alaska\u2019s Fat Bear Week 2023 has officially kicked off.      It was almost a victim of a government possible shutdown.\n  Environmental scientists believe we should fly less.      Yet one climate researcher worries he may lose his job for refusing to travel by plane.\n  The French word for bedbug is \u201cpunaise.\u201d      However, France\u2019s health minister says talk of the country being full of punaises is greatly exaggerated.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/travel/japan-rail-pass-price-increase/index.html", "section": "travel"}

On a sunny day, its battery range is around 710 kilometers (441 miles) on roads, and around 550 kilometers (342 miles) off-road, depending on the surface. In cloudy conditions, the team estimates the range could be 50 kilometers less.\n        Bosman noted that the vehicle had proved to be one-third more efficient than expected on the trip, and that its lightweight design made it less liable to get stuck on rugged terrain, and put less stress on its suspension.\n        Electric SUVs are heavier than standard electric vehicles, and require bigger, heavier batteries to power them.\n        \u201cWhere the SUV market currently innovates on the previous models, we really start from scratch and design everything ourselves,\u201d says Bosman. Minimizing the vehicle\u2019s weight was essential, and the team of 22 students focused on making every element ultra-efficient. At just 2,645 pounds (1,200 kilograms), Stella Terra weighs around 25% less than the average mid-sized SUV.\n  \ufeffThe aerodynamic design also reduces drag and uses \u201clightweight and robust\u201d composite materials to cut weight, says Bob van Ginkel, technical manager for Stella Terra.\n        \u201c(One of) the benefits of the solar panels on top is that we can have a much smaller battery because we are charging while driving,\u201d van Ginkel adds.\n        Able to travel off-road, and with no need for charging points, drivers of a solar-powered SUV are liberated to go where they please, says van Ginkel. The only restriction, he says, is \u201cwhat are you going to do when you want to sleep?\u201d\n        To answer that question, Stella Terra builds on the idea of the solar-powered campervan produced previously at the university, and the designers made elements of the SUV livable for long-distance, multi-day journeys: for example, the car\u2019s seats fully recline to create a bed. When the car is stationary, the solar panels can be extended to maximize charging, while doubling as an awning for shade.\n        Bosman says the team also designed highly efficient solar panel converters, which he hopes could be beneficial to the wider solar industry.\n        After unveiling a prototype of the SUV in September, the team traveled to Morocco to test the car on a range of off-road terrains.\n        Starting in Tangier, the team passed through the rugged Rif mountain range, where the rapid ascents and descents tested Stella Terra in its first off-road challenge.\n        Heading south through Fes, the team tested the car on the mountain trails of Midelt \u2014 one of Morocco\u2019s highest towns \u2014 and ended their trip in the Sahara Desert, challenging Stella Terra on looser, sandy tracks.\n        Early in the journey they suffered a setback when the steering system broke, but they were able to find new parts and repair the vehicle in a local workshop.\n        Bosman said that the highlight of the trip was \u201cthe huge range of landscapes and surfaces that we\u2019ve been on. Every hour of driving has been completely different. That really allowed us to test a lot, but for the team it has also been an incredible journey coming here.\u201d\n        The trip was unaffected by the massive earthquake that hit Morocco in early September, but because of the huge impact the disaster had on the country, the Stella Terra team decided to join forces with The Red Cross on a crowdfunding campaign to help those affected.\n        TUE\u2019s automotive innovation lab has been experimenting with solar-powered vehicles for over a decade, producing concept cars that are typically \u201cfive to 10 years ahead of the market,\u201d says Bosman.\n        A major challenge is turning the concept car into one that can be mass-produced. Alumni from the first TUE Solar program student team announced in 2022 that their company Lightyear was beginning production of a car fitted with solar panels.

I got lucky.\u201d\n        Barto agreed to buy the three-bedroom home, which came with around two and a half acres of land filled with around 200 olive trees, for 123,000 euros, which worked out to $123,000 as the conversion rate was $1 to the euro when the sale was completed in late 2021.\n        \u201cYou couldn\u2019t buy something [like that] in the United States for what I paid [for it],\u201d she says.\n        According to Barto, the company she\u2019d been working with took care of the paperwork, and she found the process pretty simple.\n        To qualify for the Elective Residency Visa, a long-stay permit for non-EU citizens who intend to take residence in Italy, she had to have medical insurance and provide various bank statements and financial information to prove that she had enough \u201cpassive\u201d income to support herself while living in the country.\n        Once everything was finalized, Barto started making plans for her big move to Italy.\n        \u201cIt was kind of surreal,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange feeling, packing up your life and moving over somewhere different. So I felt kind of sad but excited at the same time.\u201d\n        In October 2022, Barto returned to Italy to begin her new life.\n        \u201cMy younger sister and my ex-husband came with me and helped me get settled,\u201d she says, explaining that she and her former husband \u201cget on very well.\u201d\n        Barto says it didn\u2019t take her long to get used to life in Abruzzo, and the locals made her feel at ease straight away.\n        \u201cThey came over and greeted me with coffee and cake,\u201d she says.\n        However, Barto was initially very nervous about driving in the country.\n        \u201cItalians are very intimidating on the roads,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd of course, this is a mountainous area. So you have a lot of twisty turns, and mountain roads and little roads.\u201d\n        Thankfully, she\u2019s gotten used to this over time and says it\u2019s \u201cjust the norm,\u201d for her now.\n        \u201cI\u2019m real easy driving,\u201d she adds. \u201cI don\u2019t let anybody intimidate me. I figure well, they\u2019re gonna go around me eventually.\u201d\n        She\u2019s found life in Italy to be far more affordable than in the US, and says that most of her necessities work out less expensive.\n        While Italian residents don\u2019t pay property taxes on their main residence, non-resident property owners are required to pay a local property tax.\n        Barto is unsure whether she\u2019ll have to pay taxes on her home, but says she\u2019s confident that it will be less than what she was paying in Texas.\n        \u201cMy money goes a lot further here,\u201d she adds. \u201cGroceries are a lot cheaper here. You save a lot more money here, which I like.\u201d\n        Barto has also found that she\u2019s more adventurous in Italy, and spends much of her time exploring the country, relying on buses and trains to get her around.\n        \u201cYou can travel to different places on the train and the bus, which you just don\u2019t have in Texas,\u201d she says.\n        \u201cYou don\u2019t really have to get out and drive. You can park your car at the train station and jump on the train and be in Rome in three hours, or Venice in four or five.\u201d\n        When she was living in the US, Barto says she didn\u2019t really go very far and \u201csat around a lot.\u201d\n        \u201cBeing that I was retired, I wasn\u2019t really doing anything,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause you didn\u2019t really have a lot to do.\n        \u201cAnd it\u2019s so hot half the time in Texas in the summer, you can\u2019t really go out and do anything. \u201cHere, it forces you to get up. I\u2019ve always got something to do. And I find things to do.\u201d\n        Barto keeps tabs on what\u2019s happening back home through online newspapers and admits she\u2019s sometimes disheartened by what she reads.\n        \u201cCrime has gotten so crazy over there,\u201d she says. \u201cTexas has one of those open gun laws and there\u2019s just way too many angry people with guns. I don\u2019t miss that at all.\u201d\n        Although she hasn\u2019t been able to visit home since moving to Italy, Barto is planning to return to the US for the festive holidays.\n        She\u2019s very much looking forward to seeing her family, as well as visiting her old neighborhood and eating all of her favorite foods.\n        \u201cMexican, BBQ, Indian, one of my favorite hamburger restaurants, chicken fried steak, Chinese and a good thick steak, all things you can\u2019t get around here,\u201d she adds.\n        While she\u2019s picked up some Italian, Barto still finds the language difficult, and mainly relies on Google Translate when it comes to communicating with Italians.\n        \u201cIf I go to the bank, and I need to make a withdrawal, I\u2019ll type in, \u2018I would like to make a withdrawal\u2019\u201d she explains.\n        \u201cAnd, I\u2019ll sit there and practice in the car several times. So [that] when I get into the bank, I can tell them what I need. And they\u2019re pretty easy to understand.\u201d\n        Barto goes on to explain that she has the words written out in Italian in front of her whenever she needs to call her hairdresser to make an appointment and repeats them several times before dialing.\n        \u201cWhen they answer I\u2019ll just say it real quickly,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo I\u2019m getting it. It\u2019s funny because now when I make a hair appointment, they always laugh and say, \u2018Oh it\u2019s Barbara from Texas.\u2019\u201d\n        Barto says she\u2019s also struggled to get used to the fact that the local shops and restaurants are shut during the daytime.\n        \u201cIf you want to do anything, you\u2019ve got to either do it in the morning or you have to wait till after four,\u201d she says, adding that she sometimes finds herself caught short.\n        \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel like cooking in the United States or any other place, you can just get in the car and go get some fast food.\n        \u201cThat doesn\u2019t happen around here. So you\u2019ve got to adjust to that.\u201d\n        After living in Italy for almost a year, Barto says she feels at home and hopes to remain in the country permanently.\n        \u201cIf I have any really big health issues that I can\u2019t have taken care of here, then I would go home,\u201d she says. \u201cBut for the most part, I\u2019m going to stay here.\u201d\n        Non-citizens with Italian residence can register with the Italian National Healthcare System to access Italian public healthcare, although an annual fee may be applicable depending on the circumstances.\n        Barto has met many other expats around the country since moving there almost a year ago and is often amazed by the amount of people who\u2019ve left their lives behind for Italy.\n        \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of single women that have done it, besides me,\u201d she says. \u201cYou talk to them, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve been here for 10 years,\u2019 and they\u2019ve all settled in really well.\n        \u201cIt [moving to a different country] helps you get out of your norm. To put your big girl panties on and try something different.\u201d\n        One of Barto\u2019s favorite things about her Italian home is the view from her balcony, which looks out at the Maiella mountains.\n        \u201cI really enjoy living here. I love getting out and looking at my balcony views,\u201d she says, stressing that this is something she never takes for granted.\n        \u201cI know a lot of people say that, but I really do. It\u2019s very different when you wake up in the morning.\n        \u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018Wow,\u2019 every day. It\u2019s a different scene every morning.\u201d\n  An earlier version of this story included a photo that was misidentified as the village of Palombaro.

It was like, \u2018Do you want a new car? Or do you want to house in France?\u2019 And we decided we wanted a house in France.\u201d\n        They returned to California the following day as planned, taking some time to mull things over, before ultimately choosing to take the leap.\n        \u201cWe had to sort of do some soul searching,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cIt was like, if we do it, and it\u2019s a mistake, then so what?\n        \u201cBut if we don\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll always wonder what if. And that\u2019s what it really came down to. We were willing to take the risk.\u201d\n        When they asked the owner about the courtyard, they were told that it didn\u2019t come with the house, but she would \u201cthrow in a garden plot by the river.\u201d\n        \u201cThat sealed the deal for us,\u201d says Johnson.\n        After making their decision, they wrote to the homeowner to offer to buy the 800-year-old house, and received a reply by postcard accepting their offer.\n        \u201cJim called the notaire and asked what we needed to do,\u201d recalls Johnson. \u201cHe said the postcard would serve as our contract because the seller was a respected businesswoman and her word was good.\u201d\n        In October, Thaman flew back to France to sign the papers. The couple say they were thrilled by how simple the buying process was.\n        \u201cEverything went so smoothly,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cWe felt that it was really meant to be.\u201d\n        They married in April 2002 and were on a plane to France preparing to begin their new lives by June.\n        Once they\u2019d arrived in Cajarc, they quickly got to work on renovating their new home, breaking down the walls in order to open up the place.\n        \u201cA lot of these houses have little small rooms,\u201d explains Thaman. \u201cSo my first tool was a sledgehammer.\u201d\n        The couple had previously worked on a house together, so they had some renovating experience.\n        \u201cWe got a mattress to throw on the floor,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cWe felt like we were back in college or something.\u201d\n        They decided to color the walls \u201cthe old traditional way,\u201d using a mixture of clay dug from a hillside near their home, and lime.\n        Johnson found various used lighting fixtures for their home at sales, including a $80 chandelier that had apparently survived World War II.\n        They describe their first few years in Cajarc as \u201clike living in some sort of fantasy.\u201d\n        \u201cEven taking the garbage out was fun,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cLaundry was fun. I\u2019d hang the laundry and I\u2019d hear somebody playing squeeze box somewhere.\n        \u201cAnd we just felt like we were in a movie. It was very exciting. It was hard to explain to our friends back in the States.\u201d\n        The couple say they were \u201cimmediately accepted\u201d by the locals, who were \u201ccurious\u201d about them, particularly the younger people, who couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d left California for France.\n        \u201cWe were the first foreigners to move into our village,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cComing from California, we were like rock stars.\u201d\n        They found themselves being invited to \u201craves in the hill\u201d and various other parties around the town.\n        \u201cWe were in our 50s,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cAnd we were hanging out with people in their 20s.\n        \u201cAnd after a while we met their parents, who were more our age. But we met the parents through the kids.\u201d\n        According to the couple, many of their friends are the parents, or even grandparents of the younger locals who embraced them so warmly at the very beginning.\n        And many more friendships were made while they were sitting in their garden. In fact, they sometimes joke that they \u201cbought a garden by a river and it came with a house.\u201d\n        They fondly recall being \u201cadopted\u201d by their oldest neighbors, who would introduce them to everyone \u201cas their American kids.\u201d\n        \u201cThey [the locals] appreciated that we were doing something to a house that had been sitting there for eight years,\u201d adds Johnson.\n        \u201cThey were happy that we had taken the house on and were fixing it up.\u201d\n        They estimate that they\u2019ve spent somewhere between $10,000 to $12,000 on the renovations so far.\n        \u201cWe set it up that way, because frankly, we didn\u2019t want to have a lot of people coming and visiting us,\u201d admits Johnson.\n        The couple were inundated with visitors during their second year in the town, and although they enjoyed spending time with loved ones, having to \u201cplan around everybody else\u2019s vacations\u201d became something of a distraction.\n        \u201cAfter that, we really set limits on visitors,\u201d says Johnson, pointing out that they wanted to focus their energies on working on their home and integrating into the local community.\n        The couple have long-stay visas, which means they cannot stay in France for more than 180 days, and spend half of the year in California, where they have another house.\n        They stress that going back and forth between the two countries works well for them, and they love having their summers in France.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s just very active here in the summer,\u201d explains Johnson. \u201cAnd then in the winter, everything kind of shuts down.\u201d\n        During their winters in the US, they spend time with Thaman\u2019s children and grandchildren, and tend to any business related to their real estate investments.\n        \u201cI do enjoy the winters in California,\u201d adds Thaman. \u201cWe have a really nice house [there]. There are people I play music with and our life just works. We like having two different lives.\u201d\n        Both particularly love the simplicity of living in Cajarc, and say their worlds are much more carefree there.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t have a dishwasher,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cI don\u2019t have a clothes dryer.\n        \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of luxuries. We ride our bikes, have dinner parties, and swim in the river.\n        \u201cOur life here is super simple, and we like it. Then we go back to the States, and it\u2019s so much about money and acquisition, that it\u2019s kind of hard for us to really relate to people there.\u201d\n        Thaman shares this sentiment, explaining that he was struck by the difference between\u00a0the consumerism in California and the \u201crelative lack of it\u201d in Cajarc when they first began living there.\n        \u201cPeople buy things [in France] and hold on to them,\u201d he says.\n        Despite spending half of the year in France for over 20 years, Johnson admits that she still struggles with the language.\n        \u201cJim picks it up much easier,\u201d she says, explaining that she finds it tough to keep up with the conversation while at \u201ca big dinner party where there\u2019s a lot of cross talk.\u201d\n        \u201cI understand better than I can speak. It\u2019s still a challenge. But it\u2019s something that I get to continue to work on. It\u2019s coming.\u201d\n        In the years since they bought their home, more expats have moved in to the town. However, the couple say that around 95% of their friends there are French.\n        \u201cWe\u2019re friendly with them [the other expats,] but we are not friends with them,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cBecause we\u2019re here to live in a French community, not in an expat community.\u201d\n        When fellow Americans ask them for advice about buying a property in France, they usually suggest that they rent a place in a village for a while before making the decision to buy, as it doesn\u2019t always work out so well.\n        \u201cWe were lucky,\u201d says Thaman. \u201cWe have met quite a few people that have just jumped into something and it hasn\u2019t worked. And they have gone back to where they came from.\u201d\n        Needless to say, the couple are hugely grateful that they happened to end up in Cajarc back in 2001, and say there\u2019s no other town or village that they\u2019d rather be living in.\n        \u201cEvery time I read one of these books about people moving to Tuscany, I go, \u2018Our experience was so much more than that,\u2019\u201d says Johnson.\n        They recently had pizza with friends at the same restaurant where they \u201cfirst fantasized about a life in France\u201d during that initial visit to Cajarc and couldn\u2019t help but reflect on how wonderful the experience has turned out to be.\n        \u201cThe reality is so much better than we imagined,\u201d says Johnson.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/travel/us-couple-bought-house-france-changed-lives-carjarc/index.html", "section": "travel"}

Or do you want to house in France?\u2019 And we decided we wanted a house in France.\u201d\n        They returned to California the following day as planned, taking some time to mull things over, before ultimately choosing to take the leap.\n        \u201cWe had to sort of do some soul searching,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cIt was like, if we do it, and it\u2019s a mistake, then so what?\n        \u201cBut if we don\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll always wonder what if. And that\u2019s what it really came down to. We were willing to take the risk.\u201d\n        When they asked the owner about the courtyard, they were told that it didn\u2019t come with the house, but she would \u201cthrow in a garden plot by the river.\u201d\n        \u201cThat sealed the deal for us,\u201d says Johnson.\n        After making their decision, they wrote to the homeowner to offer to buy the 800-year-old house, and received a reply by postcard accepting their offer.\n        \u201cJim called the notaire and asked what we needed to do,\u201d recalls Johnson. \u201cHe said the postcard would serve as our contract because the seller was a respected businesswoman and her word was good.\u201d\n        In October, Thaman flew back to France to sign the papers. The couple say they were thrilled by how simple the buying process was.\n        \u201cEverything went so smoothly,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cWe felt that it was really meant to be.\u201d\n        They married in April 2002 and were on a plane to France preparing to begin their new lives by June.\n        Once they\u2019d arrived in Cajarc, they quickly got to work on renovating their new home, breaking down the walls in order to open up the place.\n        \u201cA lot of these houses have little small rooms,\u201d explains Thaman. \u201cSo my first tool was a sledgehammer.\u201d\n        The couple had previously worked on a house together, so they had some renovating experience.\n        \u201cWe got a mattress to throw on the floor,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cWe felt like we were back in college or something.\u201d\n        They decided to color the walls \u201cthe old traditional way,\u201d using a mixture of clay dug from a hillside near their home, and lime.\n        Johnson found various used lighting fixtures for their home at sales, including a $80 chandelier that had apparently survived World War II.\n        They describe their first few years in Cajarc as \u201clike living in some sort of fantasy.\u201d\n        \u201cEven taking the garbage out was fun,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cLaundry was fun. I\u2019d hang the laundry and I\u2019d hear somebody playing squeeze box somewhere.\n        \u201cAnd we just felt like we were in a movie. It was very exciting. It was hard to explain to our friends back in the States.\u201d\n        The couple say they were \u201cimmediately accepted\u201d by the locals, who were \u201ccurious\u201d about them, particularly the younger people, who couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019d left California for France.\n        \u201cWe were the first foreigners to move into our village,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cComing from California, we were like rock stars.\u201d\n        They found themselves being invited to \u201craves in the hill\u201d and various other parties around the town.\n        \u201cWe were in our 50s,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cAnd we were hanging out with people in their 20s.\n        \u201cAnd after a while we met their parents, who were more our age. But we met the parents through the kids.\u201d\n        According to the couple, many of their friends are the parents, or even grandparents of the younger locals who embraced them so warmly at the very beginning.\n        And many more friendships were made while they were sitting in their garden. In fact, they sometimes joke that they \u201cbought a garden by a river and it came with a house.\u201d\n        They fondly recall being \u201cadopted\u201d by their oldest neighbors, who would introduce them to everyone \u201cas their American kids.\u201d\n        \u201cThey [the locals] appreciated that we were doing something to a house that had been sitting there for eight years,\u201d adds Johnson.\n        \u201cThey were happy that we had taken the house on and were fixing it up.\u201d\n        They estimate that they\u2019ve spent somewhere between $10,000 to $12,000 on the renovations so far.\n        \u201cWe set it up that way, because frankly, we didn\u2019t want to have a lot of people coming and visiting us,\u201d admits Johnson.\n        The couple were inundated with visitors during their second year in the town, and although they enjoyed spending time with loved ones, having to \u201cplan around everybody else\u2019s vacations\u201d became something of a distraction.\n        \u201cAfter that, we really set limits on visitors,\u201d says Johnson, pointing out that they wanted to focus their energies on working on their home and integrating into the local community.\n        The couple have long-stay visas, which means they cannot stay in France for more than 180 days, and spend half of the year in California, where they have another house.\n        They stress that going back and forth between the two countries works well for them, and they love having their summers in France.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s just very active here in the summer,\u201d explains Johnson. \u201cAnd then in the winter, everything kind of shuts down.\u201d\n        During their winters in the US, they spend time with Thaman\u2019s children and grandchildren, and tend to any business related to their real estate investments.\n        \u201cI do enjoy the winters in California,\u201d adds Thaman. \u201cWe have a really nice house [there]. There are people I play music with and our life just works. We like having two different lives.\u201d\n        Both particularly love the simplicity of living in Cajarc, and say their worlds are much more carefree there.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t have a dishwasher,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cI don\u2019t have a clothes dryer.\n        \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of luxuries. We ride our bikes, have dinner parties, and swim in the river.\n        \u201cOur life here is super simple, and we like it. Then we go back to the States, and it\u2019s so much about money and acquisition, that it\u2019s kind of hard for us to really relate to people there.\u201d\n        Thaman shares this sentiment, explaining that he was struck by the difference between\u00a0the consumerism in California and the \u201crelative lack of it\u201d in Cajarc when they first began living there.\n        \u201cPeople buy things [in France] and hold on to them,\u201d he says.\n        Despite spending half of the year in France for over 20 years, Johnson admits that she still struggles with the language.\n        \u201cJim picks it up much easier,\u201d she says, explaining that she finds it tough to keep up with the conversation while at \u201ca big dinner party where there\u2019s a lot of cross talk.\u201d\n        \u201cI understand better than I can speak. It\u2019s still a challenge. But it\u2019s something that I get to continue to work on. It\u2019s coming.\u201d\n        In the years since they bought their home, more expats have moved in to the town. However, the couple say that around 95% of their friends there are French.\n        \u201cWe\u2019re friendly with them [the other expats,] but we are not friends with them,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cBecause we\u2019re here to live in a French community, not in an expat community.\u201d\n        When fellow Americans ask them for advice about buying a property in France, they usually suggest that they rent a place in a village for a while before making the decision to buy, as it doesn\u2019t always work out so well.\n        \u201cWe were lucky,\u201d says Thaman. \u201cWe have met quite a few people that have just jumped into something and it hasn\u2019t worked. And they have gone back to where they came from.\u201d\n        Needless to say, the couple are hugely grateful that they happened to end up in Cajarc back in 2001, and say there\u2019s no other town or village that they\u2019d rather be living in.\n        \u201cEvery time I read one of these books about people moving to Tuscany, I go, \u2018Our experience was so much more than that,\u2019\u201d says Johnson.\n        They recently had pizza with friends at the same restaurant where they \u201cfirst fantasized about a life in France\u201d during that initial visit to Cajarc and couldn\u2019t help but reflect on how wonderful the experience has turned out to be.\n        \u201cThe reality is so much better than we imagined,\u201d says Johnson.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/travel/us-couple-bought-house-france-changed-lives-carjarc/index.html", "section": "travel"}

And from March to June \u2013 whale migration season \u2013 lucky tourists may even catch a glimpse of behemoths like the blue whale and the fin whale, the two largest animals on the planet.\n        As well as migrating whales, the Azores also have resident cetaceans, including sperm whales and some dolphin species, which can be seen year-round. With nearly a third of the 94 known cetacean species in the world observed here, the archipelago consistently ranks as one of the best places on the planet to go whale watching.\n        But the centuries-old relationship between Azoreans and whales has not always been so harmonious,as Rui de Souza Martins, emeritus professor of Anthropology at the University of the Azores, explains.\n        \u201cThe archipelago was populated by settlers from mainland Portugal from the 15th century onwards,\u201d he says. \u201cThese early inhabitants, mostly farmers, limited themselves to harvesting the dead whales they found at sea or on the coast. The whale blubber was boiled down to make oil for lamps.\u201d \n        By the 18th century, the Azores\u2019 resident population of sperm whales was drawing attention from the United States. Whaling ships from Nantucket and New Bedford, Massachusetts, would make the roughly 2,300-mile voyage east to go hunting. In the age before the discovery of crude oil, the use of spermaceti (the waxy substance obtained from the head of a sperm whale) and whale oil (from blubber) for lighting and other purposes, made whaling a lucrative industry. \n        These factory-style ships would lower small wooden boats into the ocean for the hunt, then haul the dead animal onboard the larger ship for processing.\n        It wasn\u2019t only the whale carcasses that came onboard. The Americans recruited Azorean men at low pay, enticing them with the offer of residence in the US once they\u2019d worked a certain number of years on the ships. Many emigrated to Massachusetts with the whalers. \n        By the middle of the 19th century, some of those emigrants returned to the archipelago, bringing with them the knowledge of whale hunting and dedicated boat construction. They kicked off the local whaling industry, building seven-man hunting canoes and equipment. Soon, factories processing whale oil, meat and bones sprung up on the islands. \n        Whaling seems unspeakably cruel from a modern perspective, but back then it was a matter of survival. There were no other paying jobs in the islands. Many whalers \u2013 who were primarily farmhands working for rich landowners \u2013 didn\u2019t even know how to swim, but risked life and limb to provide for their families. \n        \u201cWhale hunting and the commercial processing of its derivatives was a much needed source of income for the locals,\u201d says Jos\u00e9 Carlos Garcia, sociologist and anthropology researcher. The money earned from whaling was used to pay for groceries, children\u2019s education, and other necessities. Films like 1969\u2019s \u201cThe Last Whalers\u201d and the 2019 Netflix production \u201cThe Last Whalers of S\u00e3o Miguel,\u201d provide a glimpse into the difficult lives of the Azorean whalers.\n        However, it wasn\u2019t to last forever. After crude oil was discovered in 1859, the demand for whale oil decreased dramatically in the following decades. \n        Right until the industry\u2019s end, in 1987, the practices of Azorean whalers were different from the factory ships of the Americans. They continued to hunt in their small wooden boats with handmade weapons, killing only a small number of sperm whales. Counterparts in other countries used modern vessels and sophisticated harpoons, leading to the decimation of many whale species. \n        To address this drastic decline in populations, the International Whaling Commission issued a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982. Portugal supported the ban, which meant the Azores \u2013 an autonomous region of the country \u2013 also had to comply. Pressure from local and global conservation organizations led to the eventual end of whaling in the Azores. The last whale was said to have been killed in 1987 by some disgruntled whalers from Pico island. \n        The transition away from whaling gave birth to new industries and practices \u2013 with the impetus coming from outside. In 1990, French national Serge Viallele set up the first whale watching company in the archipelago, on Pico island. \n        \u201cViallele showed that it was possible to live off the whales without killing them,\u201d says Miguel Cravinho, co-owner of Terra Azul, a whale watching company based on S\u00e3o Miguel island. \u201cThe focus quickly shifted from whaling to eco-tourism, conservation and education.\u201d\n        Today\u2019s whale watching trips aren\u2019t just fun days out for tourists; they support research, with the data collected from each of the trips used by local scientists to study behaviors and migration patterns. It is, says Cravinho, an \u201ceducational approach to whale watching.\u201d\n        Nearly 20 whale watching companies currently operate across the Azores, following global best practices and guidelines issued by the International Whaling Commission (IWC), as well as local regulations. \n        Boats must follow whales at a maximum speed of 10 knots, can only approach from 90 degrees behind, and must stay 50 meters (164 feet) away from them \u2013 or three times that distance if there\u2019s a mother and calf.\n        Only three boats may hover near the whales at any time, for a maximum 15 minutes \u2013 and sailing through a pod is not allowed. \n        To keep disturbance to a minimum, most whale watching companies in the Azores use RIBs (rigid inflatable boats) to minimize noise and emissions. The number of whale watching boats is strictly limited by a license system, which issues a maximum number per island \u2013 or per zone for the smaller islands. Hilltop lookout points known as \u201cvigias,\u201d once used by the whalers to spot prey, are now used by whale watchers to direct boats to different areas, so they don\u2019t congregate near the same animals.\n        \u201cWe developed a new and dynamic culture in which the whale took center stage as a creature of ecological, scientific, heritage, and tourist value,\u201d de Souza Martins explains. Meanwhile, museums across the islands discuss the Azores\u2019 whaling history, and you\u2019ll still see traditional 40-feet whaling canoes repurposed for sailing and rowing, used annually in summer regattas.\n        In February 2023, the archipelago was recognized as a Whale Heritage Site by the World Cetacean Alliance, an accolade described as the \u201cgold standard for responsible whale watching\u201d by its honorary president, Jean-Michel Cousteau. It is the second site in Europe and only the sixth in the world to achieve the rating.\n        Whale Heritage Sites are places that have been judged to have achieved an \u201cenvironmentally, socially and economically sustainable balance\u201d between nature, the local community and what visitors expect from the place.\n        Destinations must have already have conducted research on the whale watching in their area, and must commit to further research, education and awareness \u2013 as well as staging cultural events that celebrate cetaceans.\n        With rising tourist numbers and the increasing popularity of whale watching tours, there are concerns about the pressures on whales and their behavior. In his paper on whale watching as eco-tourism, Lu\u00eds Silva, senior research fellow at the Centre for Research in Anthropology in Lisbon analyzed potential challenges posed by the whale watching industry, both to the animal and the local community \u2013 from stress for the whales to profits going to tour company owners rather than the wider community.  \n        For now, whale watching remains a major draw for visitors to the islands. \n        \u201cThe whale has had such a remarkable journey in the Azores,\u201d says Garcia.\n        \u201cOnce considered a sea monster, it later became a useful resource. Now, it is a symbol of our collective identity and universal value.\u201d\n  Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions.

The number of whale watching boats is strictly limited by a license system, which issues a maximum number per island \u2013 or per zone for the smaller islands. Hilltop lookout points known as \u201cvigias,\u201d once used by the whalers to spot prey, are now used by whale watchers to direct boats to different areas, so they don\u2019t congregate near the same animals.\n        \u201cWe developed a new and dynamic culture in which the whale took center stage as a creature of ecological, scientific, heritage, and tourist value,\u201d de Souza Martins explains. Meanwhile, museums across the islands discuss the Azores\u2019 whaling history, and you\u2019ll still see traditional 40-feet whaling canoes repurposed for sailing and rowing, used annually in summer regattas.\n        In February 2023, the archipelago was recognized as a Whale Heritage Site by the World Cetacean Alliance, an accolade described as the \u201cgold standard for responsible whale watching\u201d by its honorary president, Jean-Michel Cousteau. It is the second site in Europe and only the sixth in the world to achieve the rating.\n        Whale Heritage Sites are places that have been judged to have achieved an \u201cenvironmentally, socially and economically sustainable balance\u201d between nature, the local community and what visitors expect from the place.\n        Destinations must have already have conducted research on the whale watching in their area, and must commit to further research, education and awareness \u2013 as well as staging cultural events that celebrate cetaceans.\n        With rising tourist numbers and the increasing popularity of whale watching tours, there are concerns about the pressures on whales and their behavior. In his paper on whale watching as eco-tourism, Lu\u00eds Silva, senior research fellow at the Centre for Research in Anthropology in Lisbon analyzed potential challenges posed by the whale watching industry, both to the animal and the local community \u2013 from stress for the whales to profits going to tour company owners rather than the wider community.  \n        For now, whale watching remains a major draw for visitors to the islands. \n        \u201cThe whale has had such a remarkable journey in the Azores,\u201d says Garcia.\n        \u201cOnce considered a sea monster, it later became a useful resource. Now, it is a symbol of our collective identity and universal value.\u201d\n  Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions.

He would later win the Pritzker Prize, which is considered the Nobel of architecture.\n        There\u2019s much more to the Opera House than, well, opera.\n        \u201cI think there\u2019s a big misconception that we\u2019re the classical arts,\u201d says Jade McKellar, chief customer officer for the Sydney Opera House.\n        \u201cWe also have contemporary music. We have a big talks program, where we\u2019ve had international and local speakers take it to our stages. We have children\u2019s programming. Any time you come to the Opera House, there\u2019ll be something on that somebody would be interested in.\u201d\n        When UNESCO added the Opera House to its World Heritage list in 2007, the praise was euphoric.\n        \u201cThe Sydney Opera House constitutes a masterpiece of 20th Century architecture,\u201d UNESCO wrote in its designation.\n        The document cited the building\u2019s \u201cunparalleled design and construction\u201d and called it \u201ca daring and visionary experiment.\u201d\n        All of these accolades might feel intimidating to a visitor. But McKellar says that the Opera House has spent years trying to open up its offerings to as wide an audience as possible.\n        That means putting Opera House programming online for more people to watch, for example. But it also means providing Opera House tours in a range of languages \u2013 from Spanish to Korean \u2013 in order to better serve international audiences, and it means having dedicated staff and programming to highlight the First Nations community.\n        Before Sydney or the Opera House existed, this piece of land was named Tubowgule by the native Gadigal people.\n        The Opera House\u2019s fine dining restaurant, Bennelong, gets its name from the Gadigal word for the Sydney harbor area, and Aboriginal artist Megan Cope made a site-specific artwork, \u201cWhispers,\u201d out of poles and oyster shells for the 50th anniversary celebrations.\n        Ultimately, McKellar says, the goal of the Opera House is to be a \u201cpeople\u2019s house,\u201d where all Australians are welcome.\n        While plenty of tourists visit the opera house to attend shows, have a meal at one of the restaurants inside the building, or just take a guided tour, the team behind the house also wants local Sydneysiders to feel like they can swing by anytime.\n        McKellar, a Sydney native, says that ethos very much mirrors her own experience. She first visited as a child, performing in a choir production of \u201cThe Pied Piper of Hamelin.\u201d As an adult, she brought out-of-town colleagues over to Opera Bar for drinks and eventually she even got married there, in one of the building\u2019s function rooms.\n        For many, tourist attractions like the opera house are once-in-a-lifetime destinations. But if there was a UNESCO World Heritage site in your neighborhood, would you go more often?\n        According to data from the Opera House, 42% of people who bought a ticket for an event or program in 2022 were first-timers.\n        In addition, viewers consumed 790,000 hours of Opera House content on YouTube.\n        For McKellar and her team, those numbers point to the fact that the Opera House is more than just a building \u2013 it\u2019s a community hub.\n        \u201cWe want everyone to think about, \u2018What am I going to do this weekend? I\u2019m going to go to the opera house, because there\u2019s something for me. I feel like I\u2019m welcome there. I see myself there.

The airship\u2019s onboard cameras and other sensors offer a low altitude form of aerial surveillance (or deterrence) \u00ad\u2013 useful in anti-poaching operations.

On a sunny day, its battery range is around 710 kilometers (441 miles) on roads, and around 550 kilometers (342 miles) off-road, depending on the surface. In cloudy conditions, the team estimates the range could be 50 kilometers less.\n        Bosman noted that the vehicle had proved to be one-third more efficient than expected on the trip, and that its lightweight design made it less liable to get stuck on rugged terrain, and put less stress on its suspension.\n        Electric SUVs are heavier than standard electric vehicles, and require bigger, heavier batteries to power them.\n        \u201cWhere the SUV market currently innovates on the previous models, we really start from scratch and design everything ourselves,\u201d says Bosman. Minimizing the vehicle\u2019s weight was essential, and the team of 22 students focused on making every element ultra-efficient. At just 2,645 pounds (1,200 kilograms), Stella Terra weighs around 25% less than the average mid-sized SUV.\n  \ufeffThe aerodynamic design also reduces drag and uses \u201clightweight and robust\u201d composite materials to cut weight, says Bob van Ginkel, technical manager for Stella Terra.\n        \u201c(One of) the benefits of the solar panels on top is that we can have a much smaller battery because we are charging while driving,\u201d van Ginkel adds.\n        Able to travel off-road, and with no need for charging points, drivers of a solar-powered SUV are liberated to go where they please, says van Ginkel. The only restriction, he says, is \u201cwhat are you going to do when you want to sleep?\u201d\n        To answer that question, Stella Terra builds on the idea of the solar-powered campervan produced previously at the university, and the designers made elements of the SUV livable for long-distance, multi-day journeys: for example, the car\u2019s seats fully recline to create a bed. When the car is stationary, the solar panels can be extended to maximize charging, while doubling as an awning for shade.\n        Bosman says the team also designed highly efficient solar panel converters, which he hopes could be beneficial to the wider solar industry.\n        After unveiling a prototype of the SUV in September, the team traveled to Morocco to test the car on a range of off-road terrains.\n        Starting in Tangier, the team passed through the rugged Rif mountain range, where the rapid ascents and descents tested Stella Terra in its first off-road challenge.\n        Heading south through Fes, the team tested the car on the mountain trails of Midelt \u2014 one of Morocco\u2019s highest towns \u2014 and ended their trip in the Sahara Desert, challenging Stella Terra on looser, sandy tracks.\n        Early in the journey they suffered a setback when the steering system broke, but they were able to find new parts and repair the vehicle in a local workshop.\n        Bosman said that the highlight of the trip was \u201cthe huge range of landscapes and surfaces that we\u2019ve been on. Every hour of driving has been completely different. That really allowed us to test a lot, but for the team it has also been an incredible journey coming here.\u201d\n        The trip was unaffected by the massive earthquake that hit Morocco in early September, but because of the huge impact the disaster had on the country, the Stella Terra team decided to join forces with The Red Cross on a crowdfunding campaign to help those affected.\n        TUE\u2019s automotive innovation lab has been experimenting with solar-powered vehicles for over a decade, producing concept cars that are typically \u201cfive to 10 years ahead of the market,\u201d says Bosman.\n        A major challenge is turning the concept car into one that can be mass-produced. Alumni from the first TUE Solar program student team announced in 2022 that their company Lightyear was beginning production of a car fitted with solar panels. Earlier this year, the company filed for bankruptcy, before relaunching months later to focus on a new, cheaper model.\n        Bosman and his peers hope their concept SUV could be mass produced in the near future. \u201cWe aim to also inspire not only everyday people, but also the automotive industry, the Ford and Chryslers of the world, to think again about their designs and to innovate faster than they currently do,\u201d says Bosman.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s up to the market now, who have the resources and the power to make this change and the switch to more sustainable vehicles.\u201d\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/travel/stella-terra-off-road-solar-powered-suv-morocco-hnk-spc/index.html", "section": "travel"}
