These stories were told in a tone that encapsulated both a yearning to seize opportunity in the West and for a life where they didn\u2019t feel like outsiders \u2014 where conformity to American culture was not a daily burden.\n        Many of these stories centered on my paternal great uncle, Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay, and his role cementing the barong Tagalog, a sheer button-down shirt often emblazoned with hand stitched embroidery, as the country\u2019s official formal wear.\n        More recently, the barong Tagalog \u2014 which translates loosely to \u201cdress of the Philippines\u201d and is often abbreviated to barong \u2014 has surged in popularity with Filipinos across the diaspora as a point of national pride and style.\n        \u201c(The barong) is inherently so glamorous,\u201d explained wardrobe stylist and fashion editor Rap Sarmiento. \u201cWith its sheerness and embroidery, it lends itself to the moment. Second generation kids are embracing this.\u201d\n        The origins of the barong are widely seen as dating back to times before the Philippines was colonized by Spain in the 15th century. Both a status symbol and everyday garment, its sheer fabric has been explained as either a practical design choice, to deal with the intense heat and humidity of the Philippines, or one borne of oppression, with Spanish colonizers wanting to ensure Filipino natives could not steal items or conceal weapons under their clothes.\n        \u201cThe Spanish took (the barong) to all of their colonies\u2026 other countries have their own versions,\u201d said Caroline Mangosing, founder and designer of Vinta Gallery, a Canadian-based brand that specializes in Filipino clothing. \u201cCuba has the guayabera with pockets. The Dominican Republic has a version with pleating.\u201d\n        During his 1953 inauguration, President Magsaysay wore a barong to show solidarity with the common man. It sparked wide acceptance of the shirt as the Philippines\u2019 answer to a formal suit or tuxedo, and became a garment which struck a strong contrast to westernized suits and ties on the global stage.\n        The inauguration marked one of many times President Magsaysay used the barong as a signal toward Philippine independence and resilience, in the period after the nearly 50-year colonization of the country by the United States had come to an end. Supporting his Filipino First Policy to strengthen and grow the economy, the President and his administration invested in garment manufacturing and textile mills, with many using the native materials from which barongs are traditionally made \u2014 pi\u00f1a (pineapple fiber) abaca (hemp) and jusi (pi\u00f1a and hemp combined), in turn stoking local industry and the general Filipino public\u2019s interest in native garments made from native fibers\u00a0\u2014 said his son (and my uncle), former Senator of the Philippines Ramon Magsaysay Jr.\n        \u201cHe was committed to supporting Filipino nationalism for our country and people,\u201d Magsaysay Jr. said. \u201c(During his inauguration), we could see him proudly showing his Filipino-made clothing and shoes to a big crowd.\u201d\n        The barong\u2019s evolution following Magsaysay\u2019s presidency is also as compelling as its colorful and complicated past. President Ferdinand Marcos\u2019 use of the garment, for example, saw its popularity wane among many Filipinos over time.\n        \u201cThere was a political hangover. People didn\u2019t want to be like them,\u201d said Mangosing of Marcos and his wife Imelda, whose predilection for Filipiniana (traditional women\u2019s dress) also saw the fashions go out of style once they were exiled from the country. \u201cAfter that, I feel like everyone stopped wearing barongs for a while, so it stopped evolving \u2014 what remained were mass-market versions in garish colors.\u201d\n        But as more Filipinos have permeated fashion, music and pop culture at large in the United States (and around the world) in recent years, the barong has bounced back in ways that are strikingly creative, individual and inspiring.\n        Vinta Gallery\u2019s barongs, which are handmade and embroidered at an atelier in the Philippines, range from $300 to $600 for a ready-to-wear version and can swing north of $1000 for custom. They are among the brand\u2019s most popular items, Mangosing told CNN, particularly those embroidered with anting-anting or other charms based on Philippine folk magic.\n        Last year, Jian DeLeon, men\u2019s fashion director at Nordstrom, collaborated with the menswear label Bode on a shirt inspired by a traditional barong, but made from a non-traditional cotton linen blend fabric.\n        \u201cI took inspiration from when French designer Pierre Cardin redesigned the (shirt) silhouette in the 1970s,\u201d De Leon said.\u00a0\u201cCardin added touches like a camp collar and French cuffs and embraced a more global style of embroidery. I think these are the kinds of projects that can put these inherently Filipino fashion items into a global context.\u201d\n        Attending a Nike \u201cFilipino Forces\u201d dinner in Los Angeles last fall, an event celebrating Filipino Americans working in music, fashion and entertainment, Sarmiento wore his father\u2019s barong over a t-shirt from Rhude, a black tennis skirt and black Margiela Tabi boots. \u201cIt was a way to bring it forward,\u201d said the stylist.\n        At the same event, designer and influencer Aleali May wore a barong with distressed jeans, hoop earrings and limited-edition Nike Air Force One sneakers.\n        \u201cWhen I first started in music, I was usually the only Filipino at events, and now it\u2019s typical to see 3 or 4 of us, so it\u2019s not unusual to see a barong being worn,\u201d said music executive Marisa Pizarro. \u201cIt\u2019s an elevated look without having to wear a suit. You rarely see suits (in creative industries) anymore.\u201d\n        Other Filipino-American celebrities have recently opted to don a barong both on red carpets and other highly visible events. Last year, Levi\u2019s created a custom-made denim barong for Jo Koy, juxtaposing the traditional garment\u2019s fabrics with the cut of a trucker jacket. Covering the opening night of Broadway musical \u201cHere Lies Love\u201d for Vogue Philippines, photographer Martin Romero noted that, \u201ca lot of the men, specifically the cast members, and a lot of the guests, wore traditional and modern barongs.\u201d Likewise, the barong has become increasingly ubiquitous among Gen Z on social media, with young people wearing brands like Vinta Gallery and The Mestizo on their Instagram and TikTok feeds.\n        NBA players Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney \u2014 who are not Filipino \u2014 recently wore barongs during their Asia tour as ambassadors for athletic brand Anta. \u201cIt looks wonderful. And feels even better, too,\u201d Thompson told Esquire Philippines of the garment. It was a gesture the magazine described as a \u201cPinoy Pride moment.\u201d\n        \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of social media and awareness of Filipino culture \u2014 wanting to wear traditional garb to show off our culture,\u201d said entrepreneur Rembrandt Flores. \u201cYounger people\u2019s interest is piqued and they are choosing to wear the barong as a source of pride and sartorial creativity.\u201d\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/style/filipino-american-fashion-barong-history/index.html", "section": "style"}

It has a unique feel to it.\u201d\n        Although it is produced using some of the methods associated with traditional leather, the blazer has a much smaller carbon footprint, without compromising on strength and breathability, say its creators. \u201cThis is the first jacket ever made by a global brand out of bacterial nanocellulose,\u201d added G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza, \u201cSo it is a pretty important milestone for the biomaterials industry.\u201d\n        G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza, whose background is in finance, founded Polybion in 2014 with his brother, Axel, whose background is in biotechnology. Together with friend and materials scientist B\u00e1rbara Gonz\u00e1lez Rol\u00f3n, they initially focused on mycelium, a root-like network of fungal threads, and opened a pilot plant for mycelium materials.\n        Then, something peculiar happened. \u201cAbout five years ago, a friend of mine stepped into my office and he showed me a kombucha jar,\u201d recalled G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza. \u201cWe isolated our first bacteria from that drink.\u201d\n        Kombucha is an increasingly popular fermented tea drink, and the bacterial biomass used to make the jacket, called Celium, comes from that jar. Since then, Polybion has almost entirely pivoted to bacterial fermentation, as it deemed it a promising new source for a high-performance leather alternative.\n        To feed the bacteria, Polybion uses scraps sourced from local canned fruit production plants, mainly from mangoes. \u201cWe feed the bacteria with fruit waste, which is extremely abundant here in central Mexico,\u201d said G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza. \u201cWe turn it into food for the bacteria by adding a special formula developed by us that converts it into a growth medium.\n        \u201cThe bacteria will then reproduce and generate the nanocellulose matrix as a metabolic byproduct, which we harvest after two weeks and then send through a tanning and finishing procedure.\u201d\n        The fruit waste would otherwise end up in a landfill, where it would decompose and generate methane \u2014 a greenhouse gas 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. Some producers, according to G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza, also burn or dump the waste illegally. The production of Celium creates about one quarter of the emissions compared to the greenest methods of leather production, and after factoring in the emissions avoided by rescuing the fruit waste, the process becomes carbon negative, G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza said.\n        Once the nanocellulose is harvested, it is treated using techniques employed by local tanneries. \u201cWe use the same equipment as animal leather tanneries, but without chromium or any toxic chemicals,\u201d said G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza. \u201cSince this material is organic, it has a natural feel to it \u2014 it breathes and wears out in a similar way to leather.

It has a unique feel to it.\u201d\n        Although it is produced using some of the methods associated with traditional leather, the blazer has a much smaller carbon footprint, without compromising on strength and breathability, say its creators. \u201cThis is the first jacket ever made by a global brand out of bacterial nanocellulose,\u201d added G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza, \u201cSo it is a pretty important milestone for the biomaterials industry.\u201d\n        G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza, whose background is in finance, founded Polybion in 2014 with his brother, Axel, whose background is in biotechnology. Together with friend and materials scientist B\u00e1rbara Gonz\u00e1lez Rol\u00f3n, they initially focused on mycelium, a root-like network of fungal threads, and opened a pilot plant for mycelium materials.\n        Then, something peculiar happened. \u201cAbout five years ago, a friend of mine stepped into my office and he showed me a kombucha jar,\u201d recalled G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza. \u201cWe isolated our first bacteria from that drink.\u201d\n        Kombucha is an increasingly popular fermented tea drink, and the bacterial biomass used to make the jacket, called Celium, comes from that jar. Since then, Polybion has almost entirely pivoted to bacterial fermentation, as it deemed it a promising new source for a high-performance leather alternative.\n        To feed the bacteria, Polybion uses scraps sourced from local canned fruit production plants, mainly from mangoes. \u201cWe feed the bacteria with fruit waste, which is extremely abundant here in central Mexico,\u201d said G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza. \u201cWe turn it into food for the bacteria by adding a special formula developed by us that converts it into a growth medium.\n        \u201cThe bacteria will then reproduce and generate the nanocellulose matrix as a metabolic byproduct, which we harvest after two weeks and then send through a tanning and finishing procedure.\u201d\n        The fruit waste would otherwise end up in a landfill, where it would decompose and generate methane \u2014 a greenhouse gas 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. Some producers, according to G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza, also burn or dump the waste illegally. The production of Celium creates about one quarter of the emissions compared to the greenest methods of leather production, and after factoring in the emissions avoided by rescuing the fruit waste, the process becomes carbon negative, G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza said.\n        Once the nanocellulose is harvested, it is treated using techniques employed by local tanneries. \u201cWe use the same equipment as animal leather tanneries, but without chromium or any toxic chemicals,\u201d said G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza. \u201cSince this material is organic, it has a natural feel to it \u2014 it breathes and wears out in a similar way to leather. This is really important, especially for luxury brands.\u201d\n        Polybion is exploring the possibility of using Celium to make something other than textiles, including cardboard, thread, construction wood, and even wound dressings. \u201cIt has the potential to become a commodity, a widespread material for a different range of applications,\u201d G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza added. \u201cBut as of right now, we are focused on a leather alternative, because we believe this application has the shortest time to market.\u201d\n        If you want to buy a bacterial jacket, you\u2019ll have to wait just a little bit longer. \u201cThe blazer is a one-of-a-kind piece and unfortunately not for sale,\u201d said Lauren Bartley, Ganni\u2019s Sustainability and CSR Director.

{"title": "      The Filipino American creatives who are reclaiming the barong\n    ", "author": "Melissa Magsaysay", "published_on": "  Updated\n        5:05 PM EDT, Mon October 23, 2023\n    ", "abstract": "Editor\u2019s Note:\u00a0This feature is part of CNN Style\u2019s series\u00a0Hyphenated, which explores the complex issue of identity among minorities in the United States.", "body": "CNN \u2014 As a first-generation child of Filipino American immigrants, I grew up with wistful stories my parents told of their homeland, rich in details from their childhoods spent in a country that seemed as foreign to me as the fictitious lands described in fairytales. These stories were told in a tone that encapsulated both a yearning to seize opportunity in the West and for a life where they didn\u2019t feel like outsiders \u2014 where conformity to American culture was not a daily burden.\n        Many of these stories centered on my paternal great uncle, Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay, and his role cementing the barong Tagalog, a sheer button-down shirt often emblazoned with hand stitched embroidery, as the country\u2019s official formal wear.\n        More recently, the barong Tagalog \u2014 which translates loosely to \u201cdress of the Philippines\u201d and is often abbreviated to barong \u2014 has surged in popularity with Filipinos across the diaspora as a point of national pride and style.\n        \u201c(The barong) is inherently so glamorous,\u201d explained wardrobe stylist and fashion editor Rap Sarmiento. \u201cWith its sheerness and embroidery, it lends itself to the moment. Second generation kids are embracing this.\u201d\n        The origins of the barong are widely seen as dating back to times before the Philippines was colonized by Spain in the 15th century. Both a status symbol and everyday garment, its sheer fabric has been explained as either a practical design choice, to deal with the intense heat and humidity of the Philippines, or one borne of oppression, with Spanish colonizers wanting to ensure Filipino natives could not steal items or conceal weapons under their clothes.\n        \u201cThe Spanish took (the barong) to all of their colonies\u2026 other countries have their own versions,\u201d said Caroline Mangosing, founder and designer of Vinta Gallery, a Canadian-based brand that specializes in Filipino clothing. \u201cCuba has the guayabera with pockets. The Dominican Republic has a version with pleating.\u201d\n        During his 1953 inauguration, President Magsaysay wore a barong to show solidarity with the common man. It sparked wide acceptance of the shirt as the Philippines\u2019 answer to a formal suit or tuxedo, and became a garment which struck a strong contrast to westernized suits and ties on the global stage.\n        The inauguration marked one of many times President Magsaysay used the barong as a signal toward Philippine independence and resilience, in the period after the nearly 50-year colonization of the country by the United States had come to an end. Supporting his Filipino First Policy to strengthen and grow the economy, the President and his administration invested in garment manufacturing and textile mills, with many using the native materials from which barongs are traditionally made \u2014 pi\u00f1a (pineapple fiber) abaca (hemp) and jusi (pi\u00f1a and hemp combined), in turn stoking local industry and the general Filipino public\u2019s interest in native garments made from native fibers\u00a0\u2014 said his son (and my uncle), former Senator of the Philippines Ramon Magsaysay Jr.\n        \u201cHe was committed to supporting Filipino nationalism for our country and people,\u201d Magsaysay Jr. said. \u201c(During his inauguration), we could see him proudly showing his Filipino-made clothing and shoes to a big crowd.\u201d\n        The barong\u2019s evolution following Magsaysay\u2019s presidency is also as compelling as its colorful and complicated past. President Ferdinand Marcos\u2019 use of the garment, for example, saw its popularity wane among many Filipinos over time.\n        \u201cThere was a political hangover. People didn\u2019t want to be like them,\u201d said Mangosing of Marcos and his wife Imelda, whose predilection for Filipiniana (traditional women\u2019s dress) also saw the fashions go out of style once they were exiled from the country. \u201cAfter that, I feel like everyone stopped wearing barongs for a while, so it stopped evolving \u2014 what remained were mass-market versions in garish colors.\u201d\n        But as more Filipinos have permeated fashion, music and pop culture at large in the United States (and around the world) in recent years, the barong has bounced back in ways that are strikingly creative, individual and inspiring.\n        Vinta Gallery\u2019s barongs, which are handmade and embroidered at an atelier in the Philippines, range from $300 to $600 for a ready-to-wear version and can swing north of $1000 for custom. They are among the brand\u2019s most popular items, Mangosing told CNN, particularly those embroidered with anting-anting or other charms based on Philippine folk magic.\n        Last year, Jian DeLeon, men\u2019s fashion director at Nordstrom, collaborated with the menswear label Bode on a shirt inspired by a traditional barong, but made from a non-traditional cotton linen blend fabric.\n        \u201cI took inspiration from when French designer Pierre Cardin redesigned the (shirt) silhouette in the 1970s,\u201d De Leon said.\u00a0\u201cCardin added touches like a camp collar and French cuffs and embraced a more global style of embroidery. I think these are the kinds of projects that can put these inherently Filipino fashion items into a global context.\u201d\n        Attending a Nike \u201cFilipino Forces\u201d dinner in Los Angeles last fall, an event celebrating Filipino Americans working in music, fashion and entertainment, Sarmiento wore his father\u2019s barong over a t-shirt from Rhude, a black tennis skirt and black Margiela Tabi boots. \u201cIt was a way to bring it forward,\u201d said the stylist.\n        At the same event, designer and influencer Aleali May wore a barong with distressed jeans, hoop earrings and limited-edition Nike Air Force One sneakers.\n        \u201cWhen I first started in music, I was usually the only Filipino at events, and now it\u2019s typical to see 3 or 4 of us, so it\u2019s not unusual to see a barong being worn,\u201d said music executive Marisa Pizarro. \u201cIt\u2019s an elevated look without having to wear a suit. You rarely see suits (in creative industries) anymore.\u201d\n        Other Filipino-American celebrities have recently opted to don a barong both on red carpets and other highly visible events. Last year, Levi\u2019s created a custom-made denim barong for Jo Koy, juxtaposing the traditional garment\u2019s fabrics with the cut of a trucker jacket. Covering the opening night of Broadway musical \u201cHere Lies Love\u201d for Vogue Philippines, photographer Martin Romero noted that, \u201ca lot of the men, specifically the cast members, and a lot of the guests, wore traditional and modern barongs.\u201d Likewise, the barong has become increasingly ubiquitous among Gen Z on social media, with young people wearing brands like Vinta Gallery and The Mestizo on their Instagram and TikTok feeds.\n        NBA players Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney \u2014 who are not Filipino \u2014 recently wore barongs during their Asia tour as ambassadors for athletic brand Anta. \u201cIt looks wonderful. And feels even better, too,\u201d Thompson told Esquire Philippines of the garment. It was a gesture the magazine described as a \u201cPinoy Pride moment.\u201d\n        \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of social media and awareness of Filipino culture \u2014 wanting to wear traditional garb to show off our culture,\u201d said entrepreneur Rembrandt Flores. \u201cYounger people\u2019s interest is piqued and they are choosing to wear the barong as a source of pride and sartorial creativity.\u201d\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/style/filipino-american-fashion-barong-history/index.html", "section": "style"}

Brand brought the artworks up to his apartment before alerting the police.\n        The six paintings had been stolen from Medemblik\u2019s former town hall after it was broken into at the start of September. In a statement at the time, the local authority confirmed a number of other objects, including a chandelier, had been taken and offered a reward of up to \u20ac10,000 (approximately $10,600) for \u201ca golden tip\u201d leading to their safe return.\n        \u201cI think this was a direct result of the recovery of the Van Gogh last month,\u201d Brand said of his efforts to find \u201cThe Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring,\u201d the artist\u2019s 1884 work. \u201cThat made headlines all over the world and one of the reasons the Van Gogh was returned was that they couldn\u2019t do anything with it \u2014 sell it or get a lesser sentence.\n        \u201cMost likely (the Medemblik thieves) got scared and maybe there was a possibility the police\ufeff were on their tracks already.

Brand brought the artworks up to his apartment before alerting the police.\n        The six paintings had been stolen from Medemblik\u2019s former town hall after it was broken into at the start of September. In a statement at the time, the local authority confirmed a number of other objects, including a chandelier, had been taken and offered a reward of up to \u20ac10,000 (approximately $10,600) for \u201ca golden tip\u201d leading to their safe return.\n        \u201cI think this was a direct result of the recovery of the Van Gogh last month,\u201d Brand said of his efforts to find \u201cThe Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring,\u201d the artist\u2019s 1884 work. \u201cThat made headlines all over the world and one of the reasons the Van Gogh was returned was that they couldn\u2019t do anything with it \u2014 sell it or get a lesser sentence.\n        \u201cMost likely (the Medemblik thieves) got scared and maybe there was a possibility the police\ufeff were on their tracks already. You either burn it, which is a bad idea because when you are caught later you get extra prison time, or they thought they would dump it at my doorstep.\u201d\n        The paintings, which together are thought to be worth around \u20ac100,000 (or $106,000), include a portrait of ancient ruler King Radboud \u2014 which is considered of particular local significance \u2014 and portraits of Prince William of Orange, Maurits of Orange, Count Jan van Nassau, Queen Wilhelmina and a scene from the Bible.

It has a unique feel to it.\u201d\n        Although it is produced using some of the methods associated with traditional leather, the blazer has a much smaller carbon footprint, without compromising on strength and breathability, say its creators. \u201cThis is the first jacket ever made by a global brand out of bacterial nanocellulose,\u201d added G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza, \u201cSo it is a pretty important milestone for the biomaterials industry.\u201d\n        G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza, whose background is in finance, founded Polybion in 2014 with his brother, Axel, whose background is in biotechnology. Together with friend and materials scientist B\u00e1rbara Gonz\u00e1lez Rol\u00f3n, they initially focused on mycelium, a root-like network of fungal threads, and opened a pilot plant for mycelium materials.\n        Then, something peculiar happened. \u201cAbout five years ago, a friend of mine stepped into my office and he showed me a kombucha jar,\u201d recalled G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza. \u201cWe isolated our first bacteria from that drink.\u201d\n        Kombucha is an increasingly popular fermented tea drink, and the bacterial biomass used to make the jacket, called Celium, comes from that jar. Since then, Polybion has almost entirely pivoted to bacterial fermentation, as it deemed it a promising new source for a high-performance leather alternative.\n        To feed the bacteria, Polybion uses scraps sourced from local canned fruit production plants, mainly from mangoes. \u201cWe feed the bacteria with fruit waste, which is extremely abundant here in central Mexico,\u201d said G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza. \u201cWe turn it into food for the bacteria by adding a special formula developed by us that converts it into a growth medium.\n        \u201cThe bacteria will then reproduce and generate the nanocellulose matrix as a metabolic byproduct, which we harvest after two weeks and then send through a tanning and finishing procedure.\u201d\n        The fruit waste would otherwise end up in a landfill, where it would decompose and generate methane \u2014 a greenhouse gas 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. Some producers, according to G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza, also burn or dump the waste illegally. The production of Celium creates about one quarter of the emissions compared to the greenest methods of leather production, and after factoring in the emissions avoided by rescuing the fruit waste, the process becomes carbon negative, G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza said.\n        Once the nanocellulose is harvested, it is treated using techniques employed by local tanneries. \u201cWe use the same equipment as animal leather tanneries, but without chromium or any toxic chemicals,\u201d said G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza. \u201cSince this material is organic, it has a natural feel to it \u2014 it breathes and wears out in a similar way to leather. This is really important, especially for luxury brands.\u201d\n        Polybion is exploring the possibility of using Celium to make something other than textiles, including cardboard, thread, construction wood, and even wound dressings. \u201cIt has the potential to become a commodity, a widespread material for a different range of applications,\u201d G\u00f3mez-Ortigoza added. \u201cBut as of right now, we are focused on a leather alternative, because we believe this application has the shortest time to market.\u201d\n        If you want to buy a bacterial jacket, you\u2019ll have to wait just a little bit longer. \u201cThe blazer is a one-of-a-kind piece and unfortunately not for sale,\u201d said Lauren Bartley, Ganni\u2019s Sustainability and CSR Director.
