It\u2019s unclear if any of them have the necessary support to\u00a0replace interim House Speaker\u00a0Patrick McHenry.\n        Once again, this House of Representatives is making history: It was the first\u00a0to use\u00a0a motion to vacate the speakership in 100 years, and now it\u00a0has become\u00a0the first Congress\u00a0to need two speaker elections with multiple ballots.\n        With so much turmoil in Congress, I have been asked by my students and the general public nearly every day, what comes next?\n        As\u00a0before, I think that history may provide some guidance, especially the study of political parties in the United States. To that end, let me introduce two more concepts from the annals of American history:\u00a0political realignment\u00a0and\u00a0deadlocked conventions. Both are venerable terms among historians and political scientists, but how do they matter in 2023? More importantly, what can they tell us about what comes next in the House of Representatives?\n        The answer to that last question, in short, is more deadlock in the House and the possible collapse of the Republican Party as we know it.\n        First, let\u2019s consider the concept of\u00a0political realignment. Historically, political realignment has occurred when groups of voters change their affiliation to a new political party or candidate, especially around presidential and midterm elections.\n        Back in 1955, influential political scientist V.O. Key\u00a0posited\u00a0the idea of realigning reelections to explain how the Republican Party of his day had come to dominate most presidential elections from Abraham Lincoln\u2019s surprise victory in 1860 until Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s ascendancy in 1932.\n        But in fact, realignment had been occurring much earlier, dating back at least to the\u00a0deadlocked election\u00a0of 1800 between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, and continuing through the beginning of the modern Democratic Party in 1828 with the\u00a0triumphant election\u00a0of Andrew Jackson.\n        Yet the period between 1852 and 1860 is\u00a0crucial\u00a0here, for it saw the last time a major political party collapsed (the Whig Party in 1854) and the dissolution of another political party (the Democratic Party\u00a0in 1860).\n        Let\u2019s start with the Whigs, whose\u00a0epic collapse\u00a0is still the stuff of historical legend. Despite having won two presidential elections and counting such notables as Daniel Webster, Henry Clay and Lincoln among their ranks, by 1854 the Whigs had become hopelessly divided into Northern and Southern factions over the issue of slavery.\n        The tipping point came with the passage of the divisive\u00a0Kansas-Nebraska Act\u00a0that permitted slavery\u00a0in all western territories.\n        The result was electrifying. The anti-slavery Whigs\u00a0felt\u00a0that the party had not gone far enough to resist the expansion of slavery, and they eventually coalesced into the Republican Party.\n        Southern Whigs, for their part,\u00a0joined\u00a0an anti-immigrant party (the American Party) or switched to supporting the Democrats. Whig partisan William Henry Seward, who would go on to become Lincoln\u2019s\u00a0secretary of state, was\u00a0content\u00a0to let his party die: \u201cLet, then, the Whig party pass. It committed a grievous fault, and grievously hath it answered [for] it. Let it march out of the field, therefore, with all the honors.\u201d\n        The collapse of the Whig Party soon signaled more divisions to come. In 1860, the Democratic Party\u00a0deadlocked\u00a0in its national convention in Charleston, South Carolina.\n        Appealing to the \u201csovereign states of the Union,\u201d Alabama secessionist William L. Yancey\u00a0demanded\u00a0further protections for the institution of slavery. When the Democratic convention refused to accept these demands, the Southern delegates\u00a0walked\u00a0out.\n        An effort to reunite the party in Baltimore in June equally\u00a0failed\u00a0to find consensus producing two candidates: Stephen Douglas of Illinois and John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. The Democratic rupture\u00a0led\u00a0in large part to the election of Lincoln and\u00a0set\u00a0the stage for later Southern secession from the Union.\n        Following the collapse of the Whig Party in 1854 and the Democratic Party\u2019s splintering in\u00a01860, American political parties have nearly collapsed numerous times.\n        The Republican Party split in 1912 when Theodore Roosevelt led a \u201cBull Moose\u201d\u00a0insurgency\u00a0against Republican William Howard Taft; the result was the election of Democrat Woodrow Wilson.\n        The 1924 Democratic Party famously\u00a0went\u00a0through 103 ballots before agreeing on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis of West Virginia.\n        In 1968, the pro- and anti-war Vietnam War factions in the Democratic Party\u00a0ruptured\u00a0over the selection of Hubert H. Humphrey as its nominee, leading to the election of Republican Richard Nixon in the fall.\n        More recently, in the election of 2020, the dissident \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement certainly\u00a0sapped\u00a0support from the Republican Party.\n        Of course, party realignment is a tricky thing since we only come to\u00a0know\u00a0that it has happened in hindsight. While some of these disputes led to realignment, often they\u00a0only\u00a0signal a loss of power for the party in question in the next election.\n        How does today\u2019s House Republican\u00a0conference\u00a0fit these patterns of disfunction? For one, the\u00a0viciousness\u00a0of the arguments within the GOP conference and\u00a0the threats to members\u00a0reveal a party in disarray. What some have termed a \u201cRepublican civil war\u201d seems aptly put, and as with the last Civil War, the consequences for the two-party system could be equally lasting.\n        For another, this intraparty animosity may well mean that we are witnessing the GOP break up in real time. Like the Whigs parted ways over the issue of slavery, Republicans today seem divided among those who wish to govern and those who wish merely to make noise.\n        If the Republicans of today remain deadlocked, they will suffer a fate similar to that of Democrats in 1860. A failure to reach a majority consensus signals the doom of an American political party.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/opinions/republicans-party-splits-in-history-balcerski/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View\u00a0more opinion\u00a0at CNN.", "body": "      It\u2019s not the end of tipping \u2014 unfortunately.\n        Like most cities, Chicago has a much lower minimum wage for restaurant staff and other workers who receive tips \u2014 $9.48 per hour compared to $15.80 for other workers. Earlier this month, the city council voted to phase out the \u201csubminimum wage\u201d over the next five years.\n        The Wall Street Journal\u00a0described\u00a0this as Chicago\u00a0eliminating the\u00a0\u201ctips-as-wage system,\u201d which makes it sound like a ban on tipping.\u00a0Some,\u00a0like economist Steve Hanke, are framing this as a sad day for diners, based on the belief that the financial incentive of tips is the only way to manage and motivate service staff.\n        Nick Kokonas, co-founder of restaurant software company Tock, argues the same, but from a positive perspective.\n        \u201cSimply put, tips will be eliminated entirely and restaurants will eventually move to a service charge equivalent to the tips,\u201d\u00a0Kokonas wrote on Twitter\u00a0in advance of Chicago\u2019s vote, citing\u00a0some of the benefits\u00a0of this shift: equalized pay between cooks and servers, less discrimination, seasonal stability of wages.\n        All of this is misleading.\n        While I\u00a0wish this ordinance was a harbinger for the end of tipping in Chicago,\u00a0having watched this play out in my hometown of Toronto, Ontario,\u00a0where tipping still occurs at most restaurants, I think that the people predicting this are wrong.\n        Based on my experience and research, I expect Chicago will see a small handful of restaurateurs transitioning to\u00a0service fees instead of tips (and getting review-bombed by people who think the money is going to the owners).\u00a0But\u00a0the majority of restaurants will leave tipping in place over fear that the sticker shock from folding the true labor cost into the menu prices will scare off customers, and that their best servers will leave them for venues where they can make the most money.\n        Indeed, if tips are\u00a0what most people claim \u2014\u00a0a voluntary gift for good service, on top of an employee\u2019s livable wage\u00a0\u2014 this law won\u2019t change\u00a0that. What\u2019s more, the restaurant business is based on an emotional relationship with diners, who for the past century have gotten used to this system, and it\u2019s very hard to\u00a0change\u00a0it.\n        It\u2019s a shame, because tipping has\u00a0always been a scam that enables restaurants to suppress labor costs, which keeps menu prices down. This sustains the illusion of an affordable dining experience because the customer is expected to pay for the labor of service staff instead of the\u00a0employer.\n        But tips are really just a replacement\u00a0for a livable wage. If restaurants had to pay a living wage to their front-of-house staff instead of expecting diners to pay employees \u201cvoluntarily,\u201d their labor costs would rise, and prices with them.\n        Letting customers determine the earnings of a business\u2019 staff, thereby subjecting them to the whims and abuses of guests, was always an odious way to employ people.\u00a0Tipping emerged as a model for employing formerly enslaved Black workers\u00a0without having to pay them a real wage, if anything at all.\n        It can lead to\u00a0economic racial discrimination\u00a0and\u00a0suppression of wages for cooks.\u00a0It\u2019s a horrible system that most companies in North America wouldn\u2019t accept.\n        Instead, restaurants should pay a living wage (if the revenue does not cover the actual cost of labor, what kind of business is it?), raise menu prices to reflect the true cost, and engage with diners about the value of treating employees like professionals, rather than plan for them to depend on the personal charity of diners.\n        I recently went\u00a0to a hospitality conference to moderate a panel about tipping. Every owner or manager I spoke with described attracting, hiring and retaining good staff as their number one challenge.\n        In my research on innovative models in hospitality, the operators I engage with, the ones challenging industry orthodoxy in a variety of ways, are holding on to their best people. Many have done this by eliminating tips, as the non-tipping restaurants usually offer better wages and benefits. They also offer more consistent hours, an investment in employees\u2019 professional growth, and most importantly a workplace where cooks and servers are not pitted against each other due to their pay disparity.\n        These businesses have effectively strategized to attract and retain quality employees. Those workers stick around because they are service professionals who want to grow their jobs into careers while being treated with respect.\n        There are some owners who still hold on to the idea that cooks work for love of food, while servers are mercenaries, motivated only by money. Despite today\u2019s dire labor shortage, precious few restaurants seem willing to re-examine their employment model in order to address it.\n        The problem I encounter, when speaking with operators candidly, is that diners have little understanding of how tips work. I still encounter people who insist it\u2019s an acronym for\u00a0\u201cto insure prompt service.\u201d\n        There\u2019s a type of diner who enjoys the power that tipping grants them over workers, who belittles service staff and expects tipped employees to flirt with them. They are a minority. But if restaurants won\u2019t evolve because their business is catering to the worst kind of customer, they are less practitioners of providing memorable culinary experiences than they are trapped in an abusive relationship.\n        I hope that this is a real moment of truth for the hospitality leaders of\u00a0Chicago \u2014 and for other cities around the country.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/opinions/chicago-restaurant-tipping-mintz/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

View\u00a0more opinion\u00a0at CNN.", "body": "      Egypt has re-emerged as a pivotal actor in the Middle East thanks to the Israel-Gaza War. Its\u00a0revived influence\u00a0was epitomized by the\u00a0summit Cairo convened on Saturday for a number of Arab and European leaders. Although it didn\u2019t produce a unified statement from the parties, underscoring the challenges of finding common\u00a0ground, it was the crucial player in drawing top leaders together after several Arab countries refused to meet with President Joe Biden earlier in the week.\n        Egypt\u2019s importance is not just as a leader among Western-allied Arab countries, however. The country is a critical\u00a0partner\u00a0for the Biden administration on all issues related to Gaza because its control of the\u00a0Rafah crossing\u00a0\u2014 currently the only point of entry into the embattled Gaza Strip since Israel closed all crossings on its borders after Hamas\u2019 October 7 terror attack \u2014 allows Egypt to dictate and leverage the terms by which humanitarian assistance can enter the Palestinian territory.\n        It\u2019s understandable if Washington, which provides Egypt with over\u00a0$1 billion per year\u00a0in military assistance, is frustrated that Cairo isn\u2019t\u00a0allowing\u00a0American citizens and other nationals to exit Gaza\u00a0via the crossing, as Egypt has seemingly made their\u00a0departure\u00a0contingent on the entry of aid. It\u2019s also understandable if humanitarian groups are frustrated that Egypt won\u2019t open its border for a humanitarian corridor to let out hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Gazans who are trying to take refuge in the south of the Gaza Strip, which Rafah sits on, as the most intense fighting rages in the north.\n        But Egypt\u2019s positions reflect serious, and legitimate, concerns. First and foremost is the fear of a massive refugee flow if the crossing were opened. A decade after the Syrian civil war started, Egypt\u00a0claims\u00a0to host 9 million refugees from different countries, with no horizon of repatriation for most in sight. For Egypt, a deluge of Palestinian refugees would not only pose humanitarian and economic challenges \u2014 Egypt is currently experiencing a devastating\u00a0economic crisis\u00a0\u2014 but also security and\u00a0political ones.\n        Egyptian\u00a0President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, in uncharacteristically explicit remarks, on Wednesday warned that transferring Palestinians into Sinai will turn the peninsula into a launching pad for attacks against Israel, eliciting Israeli reprisals, triggering war between the two countries and upending the longest peace between Israel and any Arab country.\n        Additionally, the movement of Palestinian refugees out of Gaza would evoke memories of the mass displacement that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948. Egypt fears that such an eventuality would bring an end to any future prospect of Palestinian-Israeli peace based on a two-state solution, instead bringing a diplomatic void, and inflaming Arab public opinion.\n        This concern is so widely and deeply held in the region that, even as Palestinian civilian casualties mounted after October 7, other Arab countries supported Egypt in its vehement opposition to opening the Sinai for refugees. Indeed, after concluding a tour to several Arab capitals,\u00a0Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u00a0told Al-Arabiya TV that he heard \u201cfrom virtually every \u2026 leader that I\u2019ve talked to in the region that that idea is a nonstarter, and so we do not support it.\u201d\n        Additionally, Egypt has privately held that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is ultimately\u00a0Israel\u2019s problem, and that the latter should bear any\u00a0political or territorial costs\u00a0of its resolution. During the Trump administration, an American proposal to build infrastructure in Sinai to serve Gaza was roundly rejected by Cairo, part of Egyptian fears that a slippery slope that could draw it into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n        Egypt is also concerned that open crossing could allow in Hamas and its sympathizers. Hamas is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sisi\u2019s most serious domestic political rival. And\u00a0Egypt has faced Islamist terror in the Sinai Peninsula since the 2011 revolution that toppled the Mubarak regime.\n        For all these reasons, shortly after Hamas took over Gaza in 2007,\u00a0Egypt sealed the border. By 2018, according to Human Rights Watch, Egypt had razed the entire Sinai city of Rafah on the Egyptian side of the borders, destroying thousands of homes and displacing\u00a070,000 persons, to create a\u00a0nearly mile-wide buffer zone\u00a0to prevent the movement of weapons and terrorists in tunnels between Egypt and Gaza. To emphasize the point, Egypt even\u00a0flooded those tunnels. Two years later, in 2020, Egypt built a 20-foot\u00a0reinforced concrete wallthat reaches 16 feet below ground.\n        This wall has helped ensure the war in Gaza doesn\u2019t spill over into Egypt. Like other Middle Eastern states, however, what is happening in Gaza is having an impact within Egypt, where there is a significant reservoir of support for the Palestinians. For the first time since the Mubarak days, the Egyptian government\u00a0has organized anti-Israel protests\u00a0to\u00a0try to\u00a0come out ahead of public opinion on supporting the Palestinians and better control the demonstrations.\n        The very staunch US support for Israel, which reflects longstanding\u00a0American\u00a0policy, sharpened further by the brutal nature of Hamas terror and Biden\u2019s own convictions about it, has inevitably created additional tensions in the Arab world. The view that the US is complicit in the human suffering in Gaza is widely\u00a0held\u00a0in the Arab world,\u00a0partly\u00a0out of compassion and\u00a0partly out of\u00a0political opportunism. This, naturally, complicates Egypt\u2019s engagement with the US and helps explain why the meeting with Biden last week was canceled, after (later disproven) reports of Israeli targeting a hospital in Gaza circulated.\n        However, the delicate way the US approached the cancellation, framing it as a response to the\u00a0period of mourning announced\u00a0by the three Arab countries and expressing sympathy for the victims, helped ease pressure on Sisi, who would have been criticized by his public for appearing with the US president at such highly charged times, and was no doubt appreciated in Cairo. Subsequent US policy, focusing on\u00a0delivery of aid into Gaza\u00a0also signaled support for Egypt\u2019s position, buying some goodwill from Cairo.\n        Still, if Washington is committed to the objectives of both supporting Israel in its campaign to degrade, if not eradicate, Hamas and at the same time providing critical humanitarian support to Palestinian civilians, the US will need to coordinate with its Arab allies. For reasons of geography, history and diplomatic heft, Egypt is the linchpin.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/opinions/opinion-egypt-israel-gaza-hamas-afraid-omari-schenker/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

She is simply Julia.\n        In fact, according to Orwell, she is not a woman but a\u00a0\u201cgirl,\u201d whom Winston estimates to be in her late 20s. (Tellingly, the reader never learns her age, only Winston\u2019s perception of it.)

Julia only meets O\u2019Brien, their captor and interrogator, because Winston invites her to tag along when he pays a visit to the great man\u2019s apartment.\n        At first reading, Orwell\u2019s marginalization of Julia might seem like simply a product of its time\u00a0\u2014\u00a0yet a growing body of work, including most recently\u00a0Anna Funder\u2019s\u00a0\u201cWifedom: Mrs. Orwell\u2019s Invisible Life,\u201d\u00a0has emerged suggesting that Orwell was exceptionally misogynistic and patriarchal even by the standards of the 1940s.\n        Orwell first came under attack from second-wave feminists in the 1980s, including\u00a0Daphne Patai\u00a0and\u00a0Beatrix Campbell, who argued that his work generally ignored the position of women within society and specifically obscured the\u00a0burdens that poverty places on working-class women.\n  A spate of archival revelations\u00a0over the past few years further reinforced existing evidence that he was a philanderer who frequented prostitutes and seemingly never missed an opportunity to proposition both his wife\u2019s friends and his friends\u2019 wives.\n        So, how would the story\u00a0of \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d\u00a0have looked different had it been told by a feminist?\n        For one thing, Julia would have had a last name. Julia Worthing. She would also have a fully developed backstory.\u00a0 In Newman\u2019s novel, Julia comes from a family of bourgeois socialists who are initially in the vanguard of Big Brother\u2019s revolution.\n        Her family is first exiled and ultimately murdered when the leader, like the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin on whom he was modeled, consolidates his hold on power by eliminating his potential rivals within the party.\n        Julia\u2019s sexuality and her anti-intellectual practical-mindedness are the tools that help her survive life as an exile and an orphan. \u00a0She sleeps her way back from exile and into a good party job in London.\n        She mentally compartmentalizes the crimes that she is forced to commit to survive, and she possesses a knack for black-marketeering, which keeps her in chocolates, coffee and cigarettes.\u00a0Whereas Winston\u2019s rebellion is driven by an intellectual rejection of Big Brother, hers is ultimately propelled by love. (Crucially, not love for Winston Smith who is, at best, a minor character in Julia\u2019s story).\n        It\u2019s an ingenious conceit. At several points, I found myself asking whether this portrait of Julia could really be squared with the two-dimensional picture of her that we get in\u00a0\u201cNineteen Eighty-Four,\u201d and whether the story that Newman tells could hold simultaneously\u00a0with Orwell\u2019s narrative.\u00a0That they arguably could underscores how differently the world can look depending on your perspective.\n        Newman\u2019s attempt to turn Orwell\u2019s Oceania on its head and look at it from the perspective of a woman never granted the dignity of a last name is in many ways not dissimilar to this summer\u2019s blockbuster attempt to reclaim \u201cBarbie\u201d for feminism.\n        Like Barbie Handler, Julia Worthing is a product of the patriarchy who refuses to stay in the box and let herself be objectified and diminished. She insists on being the heroine of her own story and, in doing so, pushes Winston Smith into a life of blond fragility.\n        But if the Barbie movie largely dodged the problematic question of Barbie\u2019s hypersexualized physical appearance in favor of a focus on her intellectual awakening, Newman\u2019s Julia remains fundamentally a rebel from the waist downwards.\n        Why doesn\u2019t Julia get to be an intellectual rebel in her own right? Why must she be characterized by the traditional \u201cfeminine\u201d traits of empathy, practicality and intuition, not to mention a stereotypical physical attractiveness?\n        The women\u2019s movement has long been divided between maternalist or biological feminists who view woman as fundamentally different from men and seek to elevate and celebrate that difference, and equal rights feminists who argue that gender differences are largely societal constructs and that, but for patriarchy, empathy would not be deemed a feminine trait nor intellect a masculine one. (Others, of course, would argue that the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes.)\n        In doubling down on Orwell\u2019s depiction of Julia as a practical-minded anti-intellectual, Newman\u2019s book appears to come down firmly in the former camp.\n        One of my favorite parts of the original\u00a0\u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d\u00a0is a rare instance in which Orwell grants Julia intelligence and agency, with the narrator even conceding that, \u201cIn some ways she was far more acute than Winston.\u201d\n        This moment comes as the couple are discussing the seemingly endless war between Oceania and its rivals, when \u201cshe startle[s] him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, \u2018just to keep people frightened\u2019. This was an idea that had literally never occurred to him.\u201d\n        Perhaps this is just evidence of Julia\u2019s feminine intuition, but it at least hints that she possesses a power of reasoning equal to if not beyond Winston\u2019s.\n        In exalting Julia\u2019s feminine practicality above Winston\u2019s idealism, Newman is arguably adhering to Orwell\u2019s original pessimistic message\u00a0about the futility of clinging to notions of intellectual freedom under absolute tyranny. But it is cold comfort to imagine that Julia might have survived by forfeiting her right to think for herself.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/opinions/george-orwell-1984-sandra-newman-julia-beers/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

General David Petraeus, one of the most prominent practitioners of warfare, and Lord Andrew Roberts, an eminent historian of war, have written a new book, \u201cConflict: The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine.\u201d\n        It\u2019s an insightful and thorough examination of key military conflicts over the past seven and a half decades.\u00a0The book was published as the conflict between Hamas and Israel entered its second week.\n        Petraeus and Roberts provided a sobering assessment of the challenge facing the Israeli military in trying to eliminate Hamas after its October 7 terrorist attack on southern Israel killed more than 1,400 people.\n        They emphasized that policymakers who do not have a good plan for the \u201cday after\u201d the fighting stops are simply seeding the ground for the next conflict, which in the case of Gaza necessitates some kind of positive vision for what the Palestinians can expect when the guns fall silent.\n        I interviewed\u00a0\u00a0Petraeus and Roberts for the Audible podcast\u00a0\u201cIn the Room With Peter Bergen.\u201d\u00a0 Our discussion was edited for length and clarity.\n  PETER BERGEN:\u00a0 How might this war unfold?\n  DAVID PETRAEUS:\u00a0Israel\u2019s big idea right now is to destroy Hamas, which means rendering the enemy incapable of accomplishing its mission without reconstitution. As a military commander, that means not just a lot of as-precise-as-possible airstrikes, but at some point, you have to go in on the ground, clear every building, every floor, every room, every basement, every tunnel \u2014 part of a very extensive tunnel system \u2014 against terrorists who know this place better than the backs of their hands, have demonstrated significant tactical creativity, and have\u00a0shown a willingness to blow themselves up to take Israeli soldiers with them.\n        And by the way, you not only have to clear every building like that, but you also must then retain each building by leaving a substantial force behind, one that\u2019s large enough that it can\u2019t be swarmed by the enemy who can then add captured soldiers as hostages to the over 200 hostages that have already been taken. And, of course, this will all be done in a densely populated area with substantial numbers of civilians\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even with hundreds of thousands of people\u00a0\u2014\u00a0leaving Gaza City and northern Gaza.\n        Andrew and I have gone back through all these conflicts that we recount from 1945 until now, and we can\u2019t envision a more challenging context for a military commander and soldiers than this one.\n        The big idea in the past was described as \u201cmowing the grass.\u201d\u00a0Hamas would do something particularly egregious. Israel would make a limited incursion \u2014 use a lot of air power, drone strikes and so forth to \u201cmow the grass\u201d to damage Hamas, its organization, and its infrastructure. And then Israelis would enjoy a few years of relative peace.\n        Clearly, that approach has been invalidated. But if you go in and say you mow the grass all the way down to the dirt \u2014 you can even pull the grass out \u2014 if you don\u2019t have an answer to the question of \u201cthen what\u201d that is reasonable and that can keep Hamas and Islamic Jihad from coming back, you\u2019ll have mowed the grass, and perhaps it doesn\u2019t grow back for a few years but eventually, it will, and the Israelis are going to be back in the situation that they were in before that horrific attack two weeks ago.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Some of the other obstacles that the Israelis will likely encounter in Gaza: Hostages, human shields, suicide bombers, improvised explosive devices, booby traps, snipers and fighters not in uniform. And Hamas has had years to prepare.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Also, a lot of civilians, in addition to hostages. It\u2019s hard to imagine anything more challenging than this, and that\u2019s especially true if there is a push to do this rapidly.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 The fight against ISIS in Mosul that began in late 2016, the second largest city in Iraq, seems like an interesting analogue to what may unfold in Gaza: Mosul was a city of two million people that ISIS took over and had plenty of time to dig in, its foot soldiers were willing to fight to the death.\n        How long did it take the Iraqi military assisted by American advisers and US airpower to remove ISIS from Mosul?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Over nine months. Longer if you just take the period of planning, the positioning of forces, and the setting of conditions for the attack, and that was with considerable American support \u2014 what we call \u201cadvise, assist, and enable,\u201d the enabling including lots of drones and precision munitions. And also,\u00a0a lot of situational awareness from American intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance platforms that we could put over the fighting.\n        We had an American officer in Iraqi command posts with Iraqi commanders, literally watching the same screen, watching our drone \u201cfeed,\u201d so that they could make decisions together. They could call on American air power, precision surface-to-surface munitions, and so forth.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 It still took nine months.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Exactly right. And by the way, Mosul\u2019s population wasn\u2019t two million at that time. Hundreds of thousands of civilians had left. It was certainly roughly the same size of Gaza, but not with the same number of high-rises that you find in Gaza.\u00a0.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Two of the Israeli goals seem incompatible \u2014 destroy Hamas completely and try and rescue the 200-plus hostages.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0\u00a0 It will be very challenging to accomplish both those objectives.\u00a0 And then beyond that,\u00a0how to administer Gaza after the conflict is over?\u00a0Not just handing out humanitarian assistance and rebuilding and reestablishing markets and schools and so forth, but also\u00a0conducting a\u00a0counterinsurgency campaign to ensure that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad can\u2019t come back. And of course,\u00a0a vision for the Palestinian people of what life can be like when Hamas is dismantled has to be part\u00a0of this effort as well.\n  A Regional Conflict?\u00a0ANDREW ROBERTS:\u00a0 It\u2019s also worth pointing out, of course, that you\u2019ve got to do all of this in a situation where you don\u2019t know what Iran will do next. You don\u2019t know what Hezbollah in southern Lebanon is going to do next.\u00a0The West Bank front could open up at any moment. A large number of Israeli reservists, 360,000, has been called up but if you\u2019re suddenly fighting on multiple fronts, that force gets dissipated.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 General Petraeus, you were CENTCOM commander. Your area of operation included all the countries around Israel with some kind of alignment with Iran, the Houthis in Yemen who are backed by Iran, Iranian-backed militias have a presence in Iraq, Syria is strongly backed by Iran, Hezbollah is effectively an arm of the Iranian government in Lebanon and Hamas itself has Iranian support. So, when you look at all that, what do you think?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 I think it is enormously challenging, and it could get worse. There could be regionalization of the war in a way that would be very, very serious.\u00a0You can assess that Hezbollah doesn\u2019t want to revisit the war it fought with Israel in 2006 and the damage and destruction inflicted on Hezbollah in the wake of their incursion into Israel. But Iran may push them that way, and so could public sentiment in the Shia areas in the south of Lebanon.\n  Hezbollah has 150,000 rockets, so they are not a little militia force.\u00a0That number of rockets could overwhelm Israel\u2019s air defense system.\u00a0But then, Israel would be compelled to respond with devastating strikes.\u00a0And Hezbollah knows that.\u00a0Hopefully, that knowledge will dissuade them from conducting substantial attacks on Israel.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0If this invasion happens, the pictures of destruction will just go on and on and on. The images are going to inflame the Arab world.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0The amount of battlefield imagery is a much more prominent element in conflict now than it was even 10, 15 years ago when I was privileged to command in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u00a0This is, of course, because of the widespread present proliferation of social media sites, some of which are really siloes for one view or another, the proliferation of smart phones, access to the internet, and social media\u00a0onto which individuals can upload videos, but that are not always obviously reporting truthfully.\u00a0It is also because of the greater presence of commercial imagery and other forms of open-source intelligence.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Would pressure on Hezbollah to mount a large-scale attack increase as weeks go on and more pictures of destruction come out of Gaza?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 It certainly could. So, the periods after Friday prayers will become more challenging in Muslim countries in the region, and also in Israel. This was often a challenge in Iraq when I was in command there: If there was some issue that arose that aroused the people, then tragically, it would often be amplified by the mullahs of different mosques in their Friday sermons and the resulting demonstrations could be very problematic.\n  Surprise attacksBERGEN:\u00a0 There are a couple of big themes in your book that I want to draw out. Robert Gates, the former US Secretary of Defense, kept a maxim in his office which said, \u201cThe easiest way to achieve complete strategic surprise is to commit an act that makes no sense or is even self-destructive.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Yet\u00a0you say, \u201csurprise attacks are surprisingly common.\u201d I found it fascinating that you found that dictatorships and terrorist groups are much more likely to launch surprise attacks because democracies must build consensus, which can take time. They can\u2019t just launch a war without the political support of their people.\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0It tends to be authoritarian or totalitarian powers that launch these surprise attacks. What we discovered, again and again, is that \u2014 and which I think, by the way, will also be the case here with the Gazan situation \u2014 is the response of the country that\u2019s been attacked is all the more outraged for having been the victim of a surprise attack. Look at America after Pearl Harbor. There was a sort of righteous fury that grabbed the nation and held it for four years until the US defeated Japan.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Same after 9/11, of course. Now, interestingly, President Joe Biden, in addition to expressing America\u2019s big idea, which is to have Israel\u2019s back absolutely, also offered a caution to the Israelis about what followed 9/11, acknowledging that we didn\u2019t get everything right, that the quest for vengeance can lead you to take actions that, in some respects, you might look back and say we\u2019d like to have a redo of this or that.\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 Well, partly, I think that\u2019s because, especially in response to surprise attacks, it\u2019s very difficult to promote a compromise solution if you\u2019ve just been attacked, let alone attacked in this medieval and sadistic way that Hamas has attacked in southern Israel. So, to get into the sort of frame of mind where you are offering something to the enemy requires an extraordinary degree of statesmanship that is often not present when you\u2019re the victim of a surprise attack.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0The 1973 Yom Kippur War, you cover in some detail in the book. What are the parallels with this war that Hamas has unleashed?\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 The Yom Kippur War started with an Arab surprise attack and ended with a catastrophe for the Arab armies, so hopefully, there are some direct parallels with history in this latest Hamas attack. The Israeli army was within sight of Damascus and was only a few days away from Cairo when peace broke out in 1973.\u00a0 So, there is a tremendous capacity in the IDF for taking the punches and returning them with vigor, which I\u2019m assuming will be the case when it comes to Hamas.\n  Securing GazaBERGEN:\u00a0 In 2005, the Israelis pulled out of Gaza, and elections were held which Hamas then won, and there have been no elections since. Israel doesn\u2019t seem to want to own the Gaza problem.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 They do not want to, and also they can\u2019t bring in the Palestinian Authority (the overarching Palestinian\u00a0entity based in Israel\u2019s West Bank) on the backs of Israeli tanks.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0\u00a0 In your book, you say that to secure any kind of area, as a rule of thumb, you need one security person per 50 inhabitants. There are some two million inhabitants of Gaza, which would suggest you need around 40,000 security personnel to secure Gaza. And if the Israelis aren\u2019t going to secure it, who is?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0You\u2019ve raised a very good point; whatever interim international authority might be established in Gaza will not just have to distribute humanitarian assistance, restore basic services, repair damaged infrastructure, reopen markets, schools, clinics and hospitals, and restore all the social services that Hamas\u2019 political wing have overseen. The interim authority is also going to have to conduct a counterinsurgency operation with a hard edge, with very good intelligence capabilities, because there will be remnants of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, and they will try to reestablish control in Gaza. That has to be prevented.\n        I don\u2019t know that 40,000 security personnel will be necessary in this particular case, but certainly, it will be a substantial force \u2013 and I would err on the side of larger rather than smaller.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Another one of the big themes that I took away from the book is, again and again, policymakers often have no real plan for the \u201cday after\u201d the fighting stops.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 There was an episode when I was a two-star general and commander of the great 101st Airborne Division in the early days of the fight to Baghdad, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, where we were ordered to take the city of Najaf, a city of about 400,000-500,000 people then,\u00a0and the holiest city in Shia Islam.\n        After several days of fighting, the enemy collapsed and melted away.\u00a0 We took control of the city, and I go\u00a0on the radio. I called my boss and\u00a0 said, \u201cHey, boss, I\u2019ve got good news and bad news. The good news is that we own Najaf.\u201d\n        He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the bad news?\u201d\n        I replied, \u201cWe own Najaf. What do you want us to do with it?\u201d\n        And so, I hope that some weeks, months down the road, there\u2019s not a call that\u2019s made, \u201cHey, boss, I got good news and bad news. We own Gaza City or all of Gaza. What do you want us to do with it?\u201d\n        There\u00a0has\u00a0to be a viable plan for the day after.\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 The Malayan Emergency of 1952 to \u201960 is a very good example of where the big idea was got right, not just \u201cclear and hold,\u201d but also the fact that the commander there, Sir Gerald Templer, offered the Malaysian people their independence pretty much from the beginning as they fought a communist insurgency.\n        And so that helped capture their \u201chearts and minds.\u201d That was where the original phrase came from; winning the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of the local population was essential in putting down the local communist insurgency. So, they got the population on side, which was essential, defeated the communists and independence was given in 1957.\n        I don\u2019t know how that would translate into the present Gazan situation, but there has to be something that the people on the ground can really look forward to, something positive.\n  A positive vison for the Palestinians\u00a0PETRAEUS:\u00a0There has to be a positive vision for the Palestinian people that life will be much better if Hamas is eliminated and out of their lives and that the international community will support them.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0But the Israeli government has little to no credibility with the Palestinians in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority doesn\u2019t have much credibility either because they\u2019re in the West Bank, and they\u2019re seen as almost collaborators with Israel by the folks in Gaza.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 And by the folks in the West Bank, in many cases, too.\n        It couldn\u2019t be more difficult. Andrew uses the phrase \u201cfiendishly difficult,\u201d and that is correct.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0So, if you were advising Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today from a military point of view, general, what would you advise, and Andrew, from a political point of view, what would you advise?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Well, what\u2019s interesting is I think you must combine the two. You can\u2019t just say that you\u2019re going to destroy Hamas. You also must lay out the vision for the Palestinian people and the future of Gaza.\u00a0 And this will be challenging because there will be a vision announced, I hope, but there\u2019s also going to be a substantial loss of innocent civilian life and very substantial damage and destruction of civilian infrastructure and civilian dwellings.\n  Israel\u2019s advantagesROBERTS:\u00a0 The last chapter of our book is \u201cThe Future of War,\u201d and we look at cyber and sensors and space, AI, robotics, and also, of course, drones. And this is one area where the Israelis will have an advantage.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Well, let\u2019s talk about some Israeli potential advantages. You mentioned robots. Also infrared and acoustic tools that might be able to look down into tunnels and armored bulldozers. What about morale? Morale is a major theme of your book. Whether it\u2019s the Ukrainians fighting the Russians or Israelis volunteering to fight today. It\u2019s a nebulous concept on some levels, but how important is it?\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 Morale is absolutely central to warfare. We came across this again and again in the course of writing this book. It\u2019s a very interesting thing when demoralization can take place and how it can take place. But if you\u2019ve got morale, it is \u201cworth several divisions,\u201d as Napoleon always used to say.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 You\u2019ve had a barbaric, horrific, unspeakable set of actions that killed some 1,400 Israelis, and to put that in perspective, from a US point of view, that\u2019s the equivalent of more than 50,000 Americans having been killed on 9/11, as opposed to the 3,000 terrible losses that we sustained. And the over 200 hostages are the equivalent of well over 6,000 Americans being taken hostage on that day. And I think we are not fully appreciating the impact of all this on the Israeli people and government.\n        The Israelis have enormous morale. When they were called up,\u00a0members of the reserves literally drove their own vehicles down to southern Israel.\u00a0And they just\u00a0parked their cars on the side of the road and\u00a0reported for duty.\n        But that also does raise yet one more challenge. The bulk of this force is reservists. They\u2019re not serving professionals or on active duty. Some will have done recent active duty or perhaps a lot of reserve duty but by no means all, and I\u2019m sure that there are those in the ranks who are a bit more advanced in age than the typical 19-year-old infantry soldier.\n        So, they\u2019ve got to be brought back in, reequipped, introduced to the more cutting-edge technology, say, night vision goggles and close combat optics on weapons that are very, very important so that you can have a precise fire, not just \u201cspray and pray.\u201d\u00a0 So, all of this has to be done as well. You have to reorganize, re-equip and retrain to some degree. At the very least, they\u2019ve got to get whatever weapon systems they have now and get reacquainted with that and do drills with their fellow soldiers as units.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 And, of course, reservists are people who\u2019ve got day jobs in the Israeli economy. If this continues for a long time, you have social, political, and economic effects inside Israel.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0In this case, there are multiple clocks running, but one of those is the domestic economy clock, that if you call up 360,000 out of a population that\u2019s around 10 million, obviously there\u2019s an enormous impact on the economy.\n        Beyond that, the policy makers have\u00a0essentially taken the slack out of the trigger, and there will be pressure to squeeze, perhaps sooner rather than later, because of the imperative of getting on with this.\u00a0 But that should be tempered with a recognition that urban operations need to be pursued in a deliberate, methodical, careful manner.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0General Petraeus you famously said close to the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003, \u201cTell me how this ends.\u201d How does this Gaza war end?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0It depends on the conduct of the campaign. Can they fully clear, hold and then start the rebuilding?\u00a0 Are they able to identify, in particular, a true vision for the Palestinian people that is inspiring to them?\u00a0 \u201cInspiring\u201d might be a bit of a high bar, but let\u2019s use this moment as a catalyst \u2014 this horrible, despicable, unspeakable set of barbaric murders \u2014 to try to communicate a vision for the future that can\u00a0reduce\u00a0 grievances in the future, noting that nothing can conceivably justify the atrocities committed by Hamas.\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 One thing that we can be certain of, though, in all this uncertainty is that if Israel doesn\u2019t destroy Hamas, or if it fails to, then we know how this ends, because it ends with an organization which, in the next generation, will do exactly the same thing to Israelis, will continue to kill Jews.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 General Petraeus, you\u2019re a former director of the CIA. After October 7th, we\u2019ve heard a lot about intelligence failures. The question is, when we get further away from this, do you suspect that it will be seen as mostly a policy failure, misunderstanding Hamas\u2019\u00a0aims, having kind of a too-rosy view of Hamas and so ignoring intelligence that might have been germane?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 I think this was a real intelligence failure, and I think it was also a military readiness failure. My speculation is that Hamas dramatically improved its operational security and prevented Israel from developing the understanding of the extremists\u2019 intentions well before they materialized as terrorist operations.\n        I think we\u2019ll come to understand better how creative Hamas was in using all kinds of ways to get into Israel \u2014 paragliders as well as bulldozers and golf carts. But in advance of that, they blinded the surveillance systems along the wall by taking out the communication nodes that connect those observation systems to command posts that are monitoring those systems, and so there was an overreliance on technology. And that technology was blinded at a critical moment.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0What about the US \u201cpivot to Asia?\u201d Is that sort of dead now?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 No. The primary focus of the US overall, especially the military of the US,\u00a0is rightly the Indo-Pacific region, and the situation in the Mideast doesn\u2019t detract from that. I have long felt that the term \u201cpivot\u201d was not very helpful\u2014because it implies that you\u2019re pivoting away from something, and the more accurate term \u2014 and the one that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used to use \u2014 was the \u201crebalance\u201d to Asia, and that\u2019s what we should have been saying that we were doing.\n        I always also thought that it was unwise to try to leave the Middle East to the extent that we have tried, and I think we should retain a substantial force there.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 It turns out that getting out of the Middle East is something almost every recent American president wants to do, but it never really happens.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/opinions/david-petraeus-andrew-roberts-huge-challenge-facing-israel-bergen/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

He is the author of \u201cLincoln and the Fight for Peace.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View\u00a0more opinion\u00a0at CNN.", "body": "      Threats begin when reason fails.\n        The failed full-court press to install Republican Rep. Jim Jordan as House Speaker revealed ugly examples of how violent threats are becoming normalized inside Trump\u2019s GOP.\n        After Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa switched her vote on Wednesday to oppose Jordan, she issued a statement saying she received \u201ccredible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls.\u201d\n        Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado told NBC that he\u2019d received death threats as well.\u00a0 According to Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas, the strategy behind the threats is to \u201cAttack, attack, attack. Attack the members who don\u2019t agree with you, attack them, beat them into submission.\u201d\n        This is the opposite of anything resembling deliberative democracy or politics in a civil society.\u00a0(Jim Jordan, who dropped out of the race for speaker on Friday after a secret ballot found he had lost the support of his fellow Republicans as the party\u2019s choice, condemned the death threats, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong.\u201d)\n  One voicemail in particular, left for the wife of an unnamed conservative congressman \u2014\u00a0played exclusively on our colleague Jake Tapper\u2019s show \u2014 offers a portrait of the pathology that has driven the GOP into this ditch.\n        The caller, an aggrieved man, lets loose in a tirade that needs a close reading.\n        The unhinged caller begins with a lot of furious cursing and standard dehumanization \u2014\u00a0describing the anonymous congressman as a \u201cpig\u201d because he publicly opposed Jordan. The voicemail continues, with the caller suggesting that the principled decision was due to the influence of the \u201cdeep state.\u201d This is a tell that the caller has been drinking from the right-wing media well.\n        But that\u2019s basic compared to his threats to \u201ccome follow you all over the place.\u00a0We\u2019re going to be up your ass. F\u2013\u2013king nonstop. We are now Antifa. We\u2019re going to do what the left does.\u201d\n        This is a small masterpiece of projection \u2014 one that we\u2019ve seen before in the right\u2019s baseless claims that the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol was not the work of conservative Trump supporters, but members of the leftist group Antifa.\u00a0In the run-up to that attack, members of the Proud Boys even bragged that they could dress up as Antifa.\n        The bogeyman that is the fear of Antifa has become mainstream, with conservatives often\u00a0invoking the group\u00a0or other figures they associate with the left as a scapegoat for\u00a0or distraction from\u00a0violent actions on the right\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a tactic sometimes called \u201caggressive defensiveness.\u201d\n        It\u2019s not the only illogical mind-bender. The caller repeatedly uses an anti-gay slur to describe the congressman to his (*checks notes*)\u00a0wife, reflecting the insecure mindset that masquerades as being uber macho, accusing those who are more left-leaning as being gay and therefore weak in that twisted worldview.\n        That\u2019s not all. The fanatic threatening violence also accuses the congressman of being a \u201cwarmongering piece of s\u2013-t\u201d\u2014\u00a0perhaps reflecting the post-Trump isolationist impulses on the far-right. In the next breath, however, he says that the war in Israel creates moral urgency to push through a Jim Jordan speakership.\n        Then comes the threat of doxxing. The caller says that he and unnamed others are uploading the wife\u2019s personal contact information to the internet to guarantee more harassment. This is a fear-based play from a crank who wants to seem like a member of the majority by intimidating people he disagrees with.\n        Any sense that this was a random unhinged person without a partisan political agenda was demolished by his demand that the congressman vote for \u201cJim Jordan or more conservative.\u201d This caller has explicit right-wing ideological demands.\n        If the wife doesn\u2019t succeed in switching the congressman\u2019s vote, he promises that \u201cyou\u2019re going to be f\u2013-king molested like you can\u2019t ever imagine.\u201d\n        Molested. As in sexually assaulted. And then, after a beat in which you can practically hear the gears turning in his head, the caller says, \u201cAnd again, non-violently.\u201d\u00a0This is a cynical move of the kind that allows January 6th\u00a0apologists to point to Trump saying the armed crowd should march on the capitol \u201cpeacefully.\u201d\u00a0It is a legalistic non-sequitur designed to distract from obvious intent.\n        The reason I\u2019ve run through all the elements of this threat-scape is because it reflects live-wire associations from the far-right media ecosystem. The disparate threads are all there, with the intent of intimidating people to do their will\u00a0\u2014\u00a0turning over more power to the far-right.\n        It didn\u2019t work this time. But it has in the past. After the attack on the Capitol, a Republican member of Congress told a colleague he was afraid to vote to certify the election, despite his personal, fact-based belief that Biden\u2019s win was legitimate, because he was afraid for the safety of his family.\n        Similar fears drove Republicans to not vote their conscience in Trump\u2019s second impeachment. As former Congresswoman Liz Cheney told CNN, \u201cIf you look at the vote to impeach, for example, there were members who told me that they were afraid for their own security \u2014 afraid, in some instances, for their lives.\u201d\n        So while it\u2019s notable that this effort to strongarm support for Jim Jordan failed, the attempt to normalize threats of violence are still ongoing. Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who\u00a0the House select committee on January 6 found\u00a0sent text messages confirming his involvement in the plot to overturn the 2020 election results, dismissed the death threats as being a \u201cred herring.\u201d      Jake Sherman, founder of Punchbowl News, reported that Jordan ally Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio said behind closed doors that it wasn\u2019t Jordan\u2019s fault that members of Congress were getting death threats; they had brought it upon themselves by opposing him.\n        This is the politics that Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric\u00a0has wrought\u00a0among his supporters in\u00a0the Republican Party. It reflects the furious worldview that right-wing media sells to keep its listeners addicted to the anger and anxiety, turning much of the GOP into what Utah Sen. Mitt Romney calls \u201ca pro-authoritarian party.\u201d\n        These threats of violence often use fear, promising elected officials not just physical harm, but the loss of power, reinforced by the secondary threat that they will lose their partisan primaries if they don\u2019t bow to the base.\n        This is unsustainable. But coming forward and refusing to be intimidated is a step toward breaking this hyper-partisan fever. It is a hopeful sign that Jordan couldn\u2019t ultimately win even a majority of the Republican caucus when it was put to a secret ballot. Bullies only respect strength\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and threats are really admissions of weakness, if they are called out with the confidence that comes from moral clarity and a determination to defend our democracy.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/21/opinions/violent-threats-tell-us-about-the-gop-avlon/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest\u00a0opinion takes\u00a0of the week from CNN and other outlets.", "body": "      It was the speech President Franklin D. Roosevelt never gave. In a radio address scheduled for April 13, 1945, the fourth-term president would have said, \u201cIf civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships \u2014 the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together and work together, in the same world, at peace.\u201d\n        But the day before, Roosevelt was sitting for a portrait at his cottage in Warm Springs, Georgia, when he suddenly slumped in his chair, the victim of a stroke. He didn\u2019t live to see the allies\u2019 victory in World War II that year or the conference in San Francisco that month that established the United Nations.\n        Roosevelt originally conceived of the UN as a muscular force to keep the peace, with the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom and China acting as \u201cfour policemen\u201d to rein in nations that would otherwise go to war. He wanted, in the words of the undelivered April 13 speech, \u201can end, forever, to this impractical, unrealistic settlement of the differences between governments by the mass killing of peoples.\u201d\n        The world in 2023 is a much different place, but peace, as Roosevelt envisioned it, remains elusive. A two-week-old conflict in the Middle East has already claimed thousands of lives against the backdrop of a multipolar web of alliances and rivalries in which the world\u2019s major powers often lack the ability to restrain conflict, and sometimes even encourage it.\n        On Thursday evening, though, President Joe Biden, who was a toddler when FDR died, sounded a Rooseveltian tone in asserting that the US still bears a special responsibility for seeking to promote world peace. He proposed billions in new aid to both Ukraine and Israel.\n        \u201cWe\u2019re facing an inflection point in history \u2014 one of the moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come,\u201d Biden argued. \u201cAmerican leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us, America, safe.\u201d\n        Biden spoke just after returning from a trip to Israel to demonstrate support for an ally mourning the loss of more than 1,400 people in the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack. But his diplomatic efforts to meet with Arab leaders came undone after a devastating explosion at a hospital in Gaza. While Israel released evidence that the blast resulted from a rocket misfired by militants in Gaza and US officials signaled agreement, that did not tame the fury of the Palestinians and their supporters in the region.\n        What\u2019s next?\n  Seth Moulton, a Marine Corps veteran and a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, says there are urgent lessons from America\u2019s 2003 war in Iraq.\n        \u201cIsrael is about to start an invasion of Gaza with the same mission we had in those early days in Iraq: defeat the enemy, or in Netanyahu\u2019s words,\u00a0\u2018crush and eliminate\u2019 Hamas.\u201d\n        \u201cBut the lesson America quickly learned in Iraq and Afghanistan was that you have to have a plan for the day after. Outside the southern Iraqi city of Najaf during the invasion, then Colonel David Petraeus famously asked,\u00a0\u2018Tell me how this ends\u2026.\u2019\u201d\n        \u201cThe next year, I found myself in that same city Petraeus had conquered, trying to win it back. It was my second of what would become four tours in Iraq, facing far worse combat than we saw during the invasion.\u201d\n        The origins of the two wars are very different, Moulton pointed out, but there is the commonality that in a war with insurgents, some tactics can backfire.\n        \u201cNobody wants to see five-year-old Palestinian kids killed in the crossfire with Hamas, especially if their deaths only recruit more terrorists.\u201d\n        \u201cAnd nobody wants to see five-year-old Israeli kids dying, in the same forever war, 20 years from today.\u201d\n        Israeli analyst Shmuel Rosner observed that \u201cIsrael says its goal is toppling Hamas, and Biden is no doubt asking: What comes later? Biden himself initially\u00a0supported the US 2003 war in Iraq\u00a0only to end up as the president who ordered the US pullout of Afghanistan. In the 20 years in between, he witnessed the two countries that the US invaded struggle to transform their leadership from one government to another. He is familiar with the cost involved, the chaos, the bloodshed\u2026 he surely wants to see a convincing answer to the question of the day after.\u201d\n        Biden\u2019s trip to Israel and Oval Office speech \u201cshow\u00a0a confident, experienced commander-in-chief projecting gravitas and a deep knowledge of history,\u201d according to David Mark. \u201cBiden\u2019s efforts stand out even more than usual since his likely 2024 Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has been clumsy and ineffective in trying to insert himself into these news events, as when he\u00a0praised Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terror group\u00a0based in Lebanon, in the wake of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel. At the same time, the Republicans in office are in disarray as an increasingly embarrassing Republican leadership struggle in the House has paralyzed Capitol Hill.\u201d\n  Hani Almadhoun, who grew up in the Gaza Strip, now lives in the US and works as director of philanthropy at the\u00a0United Nations Relief and Works Agency USA.\u00a0\u201cIn the northern reaches of Gaza,\u201d he wrote, \u201cover 20 members of my extended family seek shelter under the refuge of a staircase\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a frail shield against the relentless and merciless storm of airstrikes.\u201d\n        \u201cThey tread cautiously, avoiding windows and the desolate streets where the overwhelming stench of death, fire and chaos hangs heavy in the air\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cThe negative impact of this war on my family in Gaza is hard to overstate: hospitals running out of space for the dead and injured, pushing the local hospitals to\u00a0use ice cream trucks to preserve the bodies.\u201d\n  Yasmine Mohammed, whose father was born and raised in Gaza, observed that \u201csince Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel, as I have read post after post on social media referring to Hamas as\u00a0freedom fighters\u00a0involved in anti-colonial resistance, I have been struck by the devastating weight of this lie. It is an insult to Palestinians to refer to these terrorists as our freedom fighters.\u201d\n        \u201cAt the hands of Hamas, the\u00a0Jewish people\u00a0have endured horrors\u00a0not seen since the Holocaust. And, like the Nazis, Hamas does not view Jewish people as human beings. According to\u00a0its 1988 covenant, every Jew must be eradicated from this earth.\u00a0Its goal is not the genocide of Jewish people in Israel; its goal is the genocide of all Jewish people on this planet, period\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cHamas is not Gaza, and Gaza is not Hamas. Gaza is an area of land with people who are trying to do the best that they can to survive under abysmal circumstances. Gazans are just human beings, like their Israeli neighbors. They want to live in a peaceful environment where they do not have to be concerned about the safety of their children.\u201d\n        When comedian Pete Davidson was 7, his father, a New York City firefighter, died responding to the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. As Dean Obeidallah noted, that gave Davidson\u2019s cold open on last week\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d a haunting resonance.\n  \u201cIn a time when social media is filled with people saying they stand with one side or the other, Davidson instead made a plea to stand for humanity,\u201d Obeidallah observed.\n        Davidson said, \u201cI saw so many terrible pictures this week of children suffering \u2014 Israeli children and Palestinian children \u2014 and it took me back to a really horrible, horrible place.\u201d He added, \u201cNo one in this world deserves to suffer like that, especially not kids.\u201d\n        Wadea Al-Fayoume,\u00a0a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy was stabbed to death last weekend outside Chicago by his family\u2019s landlord, \u201da 71-year-old man who\u2019s been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other crimes,\u201d wrote Khaled A. Beydoun. \u201cThe attacker also stabbed Wadea\u2019s mother more than a dozen times. She\u00a0lived. But what does that word even mean anymore?\u2026 What does \u2018living\u2019 mean for\u00a0millions of Arabs and Muslims who call the United States home, burdened with the impossible task of proving their allegiance, over and over again, in response to bellowing demands that bury our humanity?\u201d\n        \u201cIt feels like we are living on borrowed time, like we were extended a contingent citizenship that can be stripped at any time, on account of events that unfold in America or on the other side of the world.\u201d\n        For more:\n  Mukesh Kapila: War didn\u2019t look like this when the Geneva Conventions were writtenFrida Ghitis: Zelensky\u2019s inescapable new realityNicole Hemmer: Why student protests against Israel are so painful, polarizing and complicatedKobi Michael, a longtime intelligence and security analyst for Israel, told Peter Bergen that Hamas used \u201cmore than 2,000 terrorists from the special unit of Hamas, the\u00a0Nukhba,\u201d \u2014or more than half the unit\u2019s total manpower \u2014 to carry out its attack on southern Israel.\n        \u201cWhat was the strategic aim of such an operation, considering that they knew for sure that the price tag would be very high and they were endangering their very existence? I\u2019m sure that Hamas was sure that the shock and horror of this operation and the casualties that they would cause would be interpreted by all the Palestinians, that this was a sign from God that this was the time to open all the battlefronts and to fight Israel and this will be the end of the state of Israel. They were sure about it.\u201d\n        Bergen wrote that \u201cKhaled Hroub,\u00a0a\u00a0Palestinian academic and the author of \u2018Hamas: A Beginner\u2019s Guide,\u2019\u00a0says he believes that Hamas did not expect that the October 7 attack on Israel would be the scale that it became, and the\u00a0group didn\u2019t have a plan\u00a0for what came afterward.\u201d\n        Neither Israel nor Hamas have \u201ca very clear plan for what happens down the road,\u201d Hroub said. \u201cEven if the Israeli military succeeded in destroying Hamas, the question facing everyone is, what\u2019s next?\u201d\n        The election of Jim Jordan as House speaker seemed \u201cto make perfect sense in the era of Trump,\u201d wrote Julian Zelizer.\n        \u201cJordan is as MAGA as they come. Indeed, he was doing MAGA along with the\u00a0Tea Party long before Trump\u00a0came to town. He has been a\u00a0staunch opponent of reproductive rights, a fervent\u00a0believer in radical deregulation, a\u00a0climate change denier, a culture wars soldier and anything-goes politician who believes government shutdowns are just part of the normal price of business.\u201d\n        Yet through three embarrassing ballots on the House floor, and after his allies in the party and the conservative media tried to squeeze the anti-Jordan members to flip in his favor, Jordan failed to gain the 217 Republican votes needed to win the post. On Friday afternoon, he lost another vote \u2014 a secret ballot among his GOP colleagues to remain the party\u2019s nominee for speaker \u2014 and was essentially forced to drop out.\n  \u201cThe question is what has gone wrong? Intimidation, bullying and political pressure certainly can work,\u201d Zelizer noted. \u201cJust look at the Republican who is by far and away the\u00a0leading contender\u00a0in the race to become the nominee for his party in 2024, former President Donald Trump.\u201d\n        \u201cIt is not a mystery that Trump has built an entire career on the power of intimidation. If you are against him, he will put all his effort in destroying you. If you stand in his way, he rallies his supporters to make it clear that you will not survive being his opponent.\u201d\n  John Avlon pointed to the intimidation tactics used against Republican legislators who refused to vote for Jordan, including an expletive-filled voicemail left for the wife of one congressman, which CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper played on air. \u201cThis is the politics that Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric has wrought among his supporters in the Republican Party,\u201d wrote Avlon. \u201cIt reflects the furious worldview that right wing media sells to keep its listeners addicted to the anger and anxiety, turning much of the GOP into what Utah Sen. Mitt Romney calls \u2018a pro-authoritarian party.\u2019\u201d\n  SE Cupp said, \u201cRepublicans are squarely to blame for where they are today, more interested in punishing each other than they are in governing or solving problems. But, what if Democrats somewhere down the line are given an opportunity to step in and restore some functionality to the House?\u201d They should take it, Cupp argued.\n        \u201cThe American people aren\u2019t stupid \u2014 they can see the mess Republicans have created for themselves. But at the end of the day, they\u2019ll grow tired of intransigence and dysfunction in Congress. And eventually, Democrats will get the blame for that, too.\u201d\n        Sidney Powell drew fame in the closing days of the Trump administration for her bizarre election-denier claims and her threat to \u201crelease the Kraken.\u201d      She never unveiled the promised evidence of fraud in the 2020 election and was instead criminally charged in Fulton County, Georgia, along with Trump and 17 other co-defendants for their alleged attempts to overturn the state\u2019s 2020 election results. On Thursday, Powell \u201creleased\u00a0herself from the case by\u00a0pleading guilty\u00a0to six misdemeanor offenses and agreeing to testify truthfully against her codefendants as part of her plea deal,\u201d wrote legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers.\n        \u201cPowell\u2019s testimony is hugely important and her plea is a big breakthrough for prosecutors. She is the first cooperating witness who was part of the limited group that met with Trump to craft the plans to overthrow the election.

Read\u00a0more opinion\u00a0at CNN.", "body": "      Most of the headlines this past week concerning former President Donald Trump\u2019s legal woes have focused on developments in two of his\u00a0four criminal cases.\n        Last Monday, in the federal 2020 election subversion case, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan\u00a0imposed a narrow gag order\u00a0to restrict Trump from making public statements attacking potential witnesses, prosecutors and court personnel. (On Friday, the judge\u00a0put a temporary hold on this gag order to give the defense and prosecution more time to brief her on the issue after Trump appealed the order.)\n        Later in the week, there were potentially significant developments in Trump\u2019s criminal case in Fulton County, Georgia, where he\u2019s charged with 13 felonies\u00a0over alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election in that state.\u00a0Two of Trump\u2019s co-defendants\u00a0in that case \u2014\u00a0Sidney Powell\u00a0and\u00a0Kenneth Chesebro\u00a0\u2014 pleaded guilty to various charges and pledged to testify for the prosecution in future cases, which could include Trump\u2019s.\n        (Trump has denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to\u00a0state\u00a0and\u00a0federal\u00a0charges stemming from attempts to overturn the 2020 election.)\n        But the case that may pose the greatest threat to Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2024 is not one of his criminal cases. Rather, it\u2019s a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0in Colorado that not only saw some bad news for Trump last week but also is scheduled to start trial this month.\n        This\u00a0case\u00a0involves a lawsuit initiated by\u00a0a liberal watchdog group\u00a0on behalf of six Colorado voters to disqualify Trump from holding office by way of\u00a0Section 3 of the 14th Amendment\u00a0over his role in events leading to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n        It seeks to block him from the 2024 primary ballot in Colorado over the amendment\u2019s provision disqualifying from future office\u00a0US officials who have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution if they have \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d and/or \u201cgiven aid or comfort\u201d to insurrectionists.\n        On Friday,\u00a0 Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace\u00a0rejected\u00a0three arguments by Trump and the Colorado GOP to dismiss the case before the scheduled October 30 trial date. One of the most powerful points the judge made was rebuffing the argument that state officials have no discretion over who is placed on the ballot if a political party wants that person listed.\n  In her ruling, Wallace wrote, \u201cIf the Party, without any oversight, can choose its preferred candidate, then it could theoretically nominate anyone regardless of their age, citizenship, residency.\u201d She added, \u201cSuch an interpretation is absurd; the Constitution and its requirements for eligibility are not suggestions, left to the political parties to determine at their sole discretion.\u201d\n        And Wallace \u2014 to the likely chagrin of Trump \u2014 cited in support of this point a\u00a02012 opinion\u00a0from Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, when he was a federal appellate judge. In that case, Gorsuch\u00a0wrote\u00a0that states do have the legal authority to \u201cexclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office.\u201d\n        Wallace did not, however,\u00a0conclude that \u201cthe Fourteenth Amendment can be used to exclude a presidential candidate from the primary ballot, or that the Secretary of State is empowered to evaluate such a question.\u201d Those issues \u2014 and others \u2014 are to be decided in the upcoming trial.\n        But this suit \u2014 if successful \u2014 could be more of a threat to Trump\u2019s candidacy than his criminal cases. Why? Trump could be convicted in any of his criminal cases, yet there\u00a0is no constitutional prohibition\u00a0that bars him from running for president. In fact, Trump\u00a0could be in prison\u00a0and still run.\n        However, if Trump loses this case over the 14th\u00a0Amendment \u2014 or any of the similar ones in states such as\u00a0Michigan and\u00a0Minnesota\u00a0\u2014 his name would not appear on the ballot in those states since he would be deemed constitutionally disqualified to be a candidate for president.\n        Trump still has a motion pending to throw out the Colorado lawsuit, and his\u00a0campaign has criticized\u00a0the Colorado judge\u2019s rulings.\u00a0\u201cShe is going against the clear weight of legal authority. We are confident the rule of law will prevail, and this decision will be reversed \u2014 whether at the Colorado Supreme Court, or at the US Supreme Court,\u201d a Trump campaign spokesperson said. \u201cTo keep the leading candidate for President of the United States off the ballot is simply wrong and un-American.\u201d\n        But regardless of the decision in Colorado, even\u00a0legal scholars\u00a0who have opined that Trump violated Section 3 of the 14th\u00a0Amendment have acknowledged that ultimately this issue must go to the US Supreme Court for a final decision. And that is the way it should be given the importance of this issue. But the Colorado case could be the one that makes it to our nation\u2019s highest court.\n        To those who dismiss the prospect of Trump being disqualified from the ballot, check out the case of former New Mexico elected official\u00a0Couy Griffin, who had been the head of a group called Cowboys for Trump.\n        A lawsuit was brought against Griffin alleging he violated Section 3 of the 14th\u00a0Amendment over his actions in connection with the January 6 attack. After a trial was held, the judge concluded \u2014 based on expert testimony \u2014 that the January 6 event was an \u201cinsurrection\u201d as\u00a0contemplated by the 14th Amendment, which\u00a0was ratified in 1868\u00a0after the Civil War.\u00a0Section 3 of the 14th Amendment\u00a0was intended to keep former Confederates from holding office after the war.\n        In 2022,\u00a0Griffin was found guilty\u00a0of a misdemeanor of trespassing on US Capitol grounds but was acquitted\u00a0of a second misdemeanor charge of disorderly and disruptive conduct.\n        The judge\u00a0deemed\u00a0Griffin to have \u201cengaged in\u201d the insurrection by his conduct of being on the Capitol grounds. As the judge\u00a0explained, \u201cOne need not personally commit acts of violence to \u2018engag[e] in\u2019 insurrection. \u2026 Engagement thus can include non-violent overt acts or words in furtherance of the insurrection.\u201d\n        Consequently, Griffin was removed from office as a commissioner\u00a0in Otero County\u00a0and barred from being on the ballot in the future in New Mexico. The September 2022 ruling marked the first time an elected official had been removed from office for participation or support of the Capitol riot. The state\u2019s Supreme Court\u00a0rejected\u00a0Griffin\u2019s final appeal to overturn the decision earlier this year.\n        To those who think it\u2019s undemocratic to ban officials from the ballot if they are found to have violated the 14th Amendment, I have two responses. First, it\u2019s far more undemocratic to \u201cengage in\u201d an insurrection designed to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. And second, we can\u2019t ignore the conditions clearly imposed on candidates set forth in the US Constitution. At least, not if we want to remain a democratic republic.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/opinions/trump-colorado-ballot-lawsuit-14th-amendment-obeidallah/index.html", "section": "opinions"}
{"title": "      Opinion: Scorsese\u2019s \u2018Killers of the Flower Moon\u2019 does a disservice to its source material\n    ", "author": "", "published_on": "", "abstract": "  Editor\u2019s Note: Noah Berlatsky (@nberlat) is a freelance writer in Chicago. The views expressed here are his own. View\u00a0more opinion\u00a0articles on CNN.", "body": "      \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d\u00a0is about an important topic: a series of horrific murders in the Osage Nation in the 1920s. To convey that gravitas, Martin Scorsese has very self-consciously made an Important Movie. Leonardo\u00a0DiCaprio\u00a0and Robert De Niro give big, Oscar-eyeing performances. And the runtime is 3 hours and 26 minutes\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a marathon apparently designed to bludgeon viewers into submission with meaning.\n        The heavy-handed approach, unfortunately, tends to squeeze a lot of the nuance and insight out of its source material. David Grann\u2019s thoughtful, painful nonfiction account, which inspired the film, is much more humble in ambition. But for that very reason, it leaves space for a less familiar, and less comforting story about collective, rather than individual;\u00a0evil;\u00a0and the petty hatreds, small as life, which enable the accumulation of death.\n  A finalist for the National Book Award, Grann\u2019s 2017 book is structured more or less as a detective story. The Osage\u00a0tribe were forced off lands in the Ohio and Mississippi River\u00a0valleys and settled in supposedly worthless land in Oklahoma. When they discover oil there, however, the Osage people become wealthy.\u00a0That sets the stage for unscrupulous locals to target\u00a0many of\u00a0them for their share of the oil wealth, or \u201chead rights.\u201d Tom White, an agent in the nascent FBI, comes from Washington to investigate deaths that seem to center around the family of\u00a0Mollie Burkhart. His investigation specifically leads him to\u00a0Mollie\u2019s husband, Ernest, and Ernest\u2019s uncle, William King Hale, a wealthy community leader and philanthropist.\n        If that was all there was to the story, it would fit into Hollywood White savior narratives fairly easily, with Tom White as the hero bringing villainous gangsters to justice. But Grann,\u00a0a staff writer for The New Yorker,\u00a0very deliberately\u00a0avoids that route. Instead, the conclusion of his book presents evidence that Hale was far from alone.\n        Because of racism, the Osage were deemed legally incompetent to\u00a0handle their own affairs, and forced to get\u00a0their\u00a0money only through designated local White\u00a0guardians. Osage people also had little recourse in the racist court system. This created huge incentives for graft and even for murder.\n        Hale and\u00a0Burkhart were caught and sent to prison for a time. But Grann doesn\u2019t believe they were the only killers. Instead, White people cultivated what Grann calls \u201ca culture of murder\u201d involving doctors, judges, sheriffs\u00a0and virtually everyone at the state level and beyond. Ultimately, various federal officials and Tom White himself were complicit in a system which incentivized the dispossession and brutalization of Osage people, whose wealth was seen as an unacceptable affront by White society.\n        Grann\u2019s book, with its reliance on a detective genre of singular culprits and courtroom justice, is insufficient to encompass the crime against the Osage.\u00a0Grann can try to trace the outlines of injustice, but his pages are too small to contain it, or even describe it fully.\n        Scorsese doesn\u2019t totally abandon those insights. He shows how being forced to go through\u00a0White guardians to access their money humiliates the Osage and makes them vulnerable. He adds a coda which acknowledges that not every villain in the piece is brought to justice. But he doesn\u2019t really follow up on those threads, or use them to acknowledge the limitations of his own project.\n        Instead, he defaults to\u00a0that standard Scorsese genre, the gangster picture. Having cast De Niro as Hale and DiCaprio as\u00a0Burkhart, the director has committed himself to focusing on the bad guys. And so he does. We\u2019re treated to a lot of De Niro uttering good-natured slick threats as he did in Scorsese\u2019s \u201cGoodfellas.\u201d There\u2019s also a scene with a paddle that more or less consciously evokes one of De Niro\u2019s more famous set pieces with a baseball bat in \u201cThe Untouchables.\u201d (This sequence is very much not in the book.)\n  DiCaprio gets the most screentime in a role that again has precedent in Scorsese\u2019s oeuvre. He\u2019s the conflicted antihero who is maybe little more than a villain, in the tradition of DeNiro in \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and \u201cRaging Bull\u201d\u00a0or Ray Liotta in \u201cGoodfellas.\u201d Film\u00a0Burkhart \u00a0truly does love his wife; his relationship with\u00a0Mollie (Lily Gladstone) is sweetly romantic and also corrupted by greed and abuse in ways that\u00a0Burkhart isn\u2019t willing to admit even to himself. DiCaprio\u2019s performance is all sideways looks and shuffling evasion, with moments of dashing charm. It\u2019s very well done, and, again, well-designed to wow the Oscar committee.\n        But should a movie about systemic racist violence really be focused on the Oscar-turn of the White villain? Scorsese has repeatedly, and with some justice, lambasted the sameness of blockbuster superhero films. But \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d reveals that Scorsese\u2019s narrative, genre-anchored, humanist approach to big, important filmmaking has serious limitations as well.\n        There are\u00a0films that\u00a0deal thoughtfully with genocide and structural violence:\u00a0For example,\u00a0Joshua Oppenheimer\u2019s \u201cThe Act of Killing,\u201d Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski\u2019s \u201cIda,\u201d Alain Resnais\u2019 \u201cNight and Fog.\u201d Those are all films which resolutely avoid pulp gestures, celebrity turns, and easy questions about the origin of evil, much less easy answers. In contrast, Scorsese\u2019s focus on individual character and internal moral struggle is ill-suited to a story about White supremacy and the way in which individual evil is a collective endeavor\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a\u00a0structure of permission, hate, envy and discrimination which is so horrible in part because it\u2019s so\u00a0undramatic. Ernest\u00a0Burkhart isn\u2019t a fascinating conflicted villain; he\u2019s just another White guy whose entire community agrees that he\u2019s entitled to take what he wants from people who aren\u2019t White.\n        Grann understood that. He doesn\u2019t spend much time speculating in his book about\u00a0Burkhart\u2019s \u00a0motives or\u00a0Burkhart\u2019s soul.\u00a0Scorsese, though, wants a sweeping epic; he wants drama, deep character development, profound human insight. \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d has all the expected hallmarks of a quality Scorsese film. It\u2019s complete; it\u2019s controlled. Which is why, perhaps, it feels like it doesn\u2019t do justice to the Osage\u2019s story,\u00a0which, as Grann realizes, is defined by absences, erasures and narratives that can never be told now, no matter how long you make a movie\u2019s run time.\n  Correction: This essay has been updated to correct that the Osage people became wealthy through their discovery of oil in Oklahoma.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/opinions/killers-of-the-flower-moon-scorsese-morality-berlatsky/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

My taste in books runs a fairly wide gamut with few exceptions, one of them being mysteries. So, I was quite surprised to find myself immersed in\u00a0Louise Penny\u2019s Inspector Gamache novels, all 18 of them.\n        After I received a diagnosis for breast cancer in December of 2022, Peter, one of my closest friends, told me to read Penny\u2019s books. He assured me that the books would transport me to a different world, Three Pines, and that I would find the main character, Inspector Gamache, fascinating.\n        With my surgery scheduled for late December, I began the search to find the books in the used section of my local bookstore. I found comfort in seeing the pile of books on my nightstand grow as I successfully hunted them down. Knowing that I would not run out of books, no matter how many sleepless nights I might be facing, calmed me.\n        Peter was right. I fell into the trance of Three Pines; the aroma of the croissants, the caf\u00e9 au laits and the cast of characters took hold of my mind and transported me away from the fear gripping me.\n        Surgery was\u00a0followed by chemotherapy and then radiation. Between being immunocompromised and suffering side effects from my treatments, my world became quite small. With my limited energy, I plowed through one book after the next, relishing Inspector Gamache\u2019s mantra, \u201cAll will be well.\u201d I whispered these words to myself before every medical intervention.\n        On one especially uncomfortable night when sleep eluded me, I took my book and moved to an empty bedroom so as not to disturb my husband. Plumping the pillows and tucking into the twin bed, I was suddenly transported not to Three Pines, but to the bedroom of my childhood with a different book in hand,\u00a0\u201dThe Hidden Staircase,\u201d a Nancy Drew mystery.\n        My mother disapproved of Nancy Drew books, saying they were \u201cnot literature.\u201d Apparently, my local library shared her perspective because it didn\u2019t carry them. Whenever I saved enough money from my allowance, I would walk to the local five and 10 cent store and buy a Nancy Drew mystery and a Three Musketeers candy bar, another forbidden fruit in my home.\n        Climbing into bed with my contraband, flashlight in hand, I devoured my book and candy,\u00a0seeking comfort in Nancy\u2019s ability to bring order to the chaos of each book\u2019s dilemma. I don\u2019t remember the details of those books as much as learning from them that girls could solve problems and the world played fair, the bad guy always got caught.\n        The structure of these books was a stark contrast to the nightly fighting that filled my house. I was 10 years old, and my parents\u2019 marriage was splintering apart. Within the year my mother would leave without me.\n        Returning to my Louise Penny mystery that night, I realized that perhaps it was the memory of those lonely nights from my childhood that kept me from reading mystery books. I never wanted to feel fear like that again, and yet here I was afraid for what would become of my life if the cancer wasn\u2019t cured. Now the fight was within me instead of seeping through a shared bedroom wall. Could I really trust that all would be well?\n        It\u2019s been a long time since I believed the world is fair. And there is nothing fair about a cancer diagnosis. In contrast, my belief that girls can solve problems has only gotten stronger. The women physicians who took care of me are a stunning reminder of how the world has changed since my childhood.\n        But most of all, I still believe in the power of the written word to help us through dark nights when sleep is slow to come. There is no mystery in that.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/opinions/cancer-recovery-books-reading-mulqueen/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

President Bill Clinton, in his\u00a0successful 1996 reelection bid, spent the late months of his campaign\u00a0negotiating legislative deals\u00a0with a Republican-majority Congress. And President Barack Obama, in late October 2012, took time off the campaign trail in his ultimately\u00a0winning bid\u00a0to lead the federal response to\u00a0Hurricane Sandy\u00a0in the Northeast.\n        A bit over a year out from Election Day 2024,\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0is taking a similar approach, by dint of a morbid and tragic pair of international crises.\u00a0By taking a lightning-fast visit to Tel Aviv on Wednesday after a similar wartime visit to Ukraine a few months earlier, and making a primetime appeal to American voters Thursday to support both Israel and Ukraine in their wars against evil forces, Biden is reaping political dividends by\u00a0playing\u00a0the statesman.\n        Biden\u2019s efforts stand out even more than usual since his likely 2024 Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has been clumsy and ineffective in trying to insert himself into these news events, as when he\u00a0praised\u00a0Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terror group\u00a0based in Lebanon, in the wake of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel. At the same time, the Republicans in office are in disarray as an increasingly embarrassing Republican leadership struggle in the House has paralyzed Capitol Hill.\n  Biden, in contrast, appears capable and steadfast. For 20 months, he has been a\u00a0stalwart defender\u00a0of Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia. And for nearly two weeks Biden demonstrated steely\u00a0support for Israel\u00a0as the Middle East\u2019s only democracy responds to Hamas\u2019\u00a0October 7 attacks\u00a0that claimed some 1,400 lives, among then 32 Americans. He noted during his TV address that his\u00a0quick trip\u00a0to Israel is the first of an American president to the country during war-time, while his touchdown in Ukraine in February was the first time a US president entered a warzone not controlled by the US.\n        Whatever\u00a0effect they have on the diplomatic front, Biden\u2019s\u00a0Israel trip\u00a0and Thursday night prime time\u00a0television address\u00a0can only help his reelection efforts at this point, especially if he faces Trump.\u00a0Both show\u00a0a confident, experienced commander-in-chief projecting gravitas and a deep knowledge of history, having made official\u00a0visits to Israel\u00a0going back to 1973 as a freshman senator from Delaware.\n        Biden made the long journey\u00a0despite predictable criticism\u00a0that he\u2019s tilted too far in Israel\u2019s direction at the expense of the Palestinians. Arab allies who he\u2019d hoped to meet with instead snubbed him, and Muslim protesters have taken to the streets in cities around the world in opposition to Israel and its American backers.\n        Many observers also said he didn\u2019t achieve much, but in Biden\u2019s roughly seven-and-a-half hour Israel visit\u00a0Wednesday, in which he met government officials,\u00a0first responders\u00a0and families of terror victims, among others, he was able to secure his two main goals: to reassure the Israeli public he stood with them and against terrorists, giving them strength for the fight as well as space to\u00a0demand concessions if needed. And he also hammered out a\u00a0limited plan for getting humanitarian aid into Gaza from Egypt\u00a0for civilians effectively trapped in the small territory, which will hopefully serve as a template for more to come.\n        But Biden\u2019s key audience was the domestic one. He wanted to win over the American public, and pro-Israel community specifically, which is why images of the president\u00a0hugging\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are so politically potent.\u00a0The Middle East trip by Biden, who turns 81 on November 20, also offered a none-to-subtle rejoinder to\u00a0GOP criticisms\u00a0that he\u2019s too old for a second term. (Granted, having\u00a0Air Force One\u00a0at the president\u2019s beck-and-call is an easier form of travel for the 12-hour Washington, DC,-to-Tel Aviv flight than an economy seat on El Al.)\n        Some Republicans even offered grudging praise for Biden\u2019s Israel trip. His urgent diplomatic mission sharply contrasts with House Republicans\u2019\u00a0infighting in Washington, where the inability of the majority party to\u00a0select a speaker\u00a0from among its own members\u00a0means the body can\u2019t take any steps to help the war effort. Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee even\u00a0called Biden\u2019s trip\u00a0a \u201cgutsy, bold move.\u201d\n        Biden also drew some plaudits from the right over his television address, which\u00a0directly appealed\u00a0to Americansfor support in the wars in Israel and Ukraine, including an\u00a0$100 billion aid package\u00a0he plans to send to Congress shortly (if there is a Congress).\u00a0He also underscored America\u2019s commitment to its leadership role in the world and the values it has historically promoted.\n        \u201cIt may be remembered as one of the best, if not the best, speeches of his presidency. He was firm, he was unequivocal, he was strong,\u201d Fox News political analyst\u00a0Brit Hume said\u00a0of Biden, offering rare praise.\n        Of course, many prominent conservatives still found grounds for panning the Democratic president. His trip\u00a0drew scorn\u00a0from 2024 Republican presidential candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, as well as\u00a0mockery\u00a0from Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham. \u201cHe was mumbling, reading his note cards and called Hamas \u2018the other team,\u2019\u201d Ingraham wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n        Nor has Biden been spared criticism from some Democrats. Members of the party\u2019s\u00a0far-left fringe\u00a0have\u00a0effectively blamed Israel\u00a0for taking defensive military measures against Hamas in Gaza after its terror attacks ended in the highest Jewish casualty count\u00a0since the Holocaust.\u00a0And the progressive wing has been making inroads into the Democratic Party\u2019s support for Israel as a whole. According to Gallup, Democratic support for Israel\u00a0has been sliding\u00a0for years.\u00a0Per one CBS News poll, a majority of Democrats don\u2019t favor sending extra weapons and supplies to Israel at this time.\n        More broadly, though, Biden is capitalizing on solid political ground. Massive majorities support sending humanitarian aid to Israel and a poll released by Quinnipiac\u00a0University\u00a0on Tuesday, roughly\u00a061% said\u00a0their sympathies lie with Israel. Even more voters (around 65%) agree with Biden that supporting Ukraine is in America\u2019s national interest.\n        So, on balance, Biden\u2019s resolute support\u00a0of Israel\u00a0is likely to help more than hurt, especially as it strengthens his centrist credentials. And swing voters are the ones Biden really needs to win reelection in 2024. At the same time, there\u2019s little evidence to date that progressives will break with him over support for Israel if Trump is the 2024 Republican nominee.\n        The foreign policy moves could particularly help with voters in swing states if they read it as him pushing back against his party\u2019s most extreme elements,\u00a0as some pro-Israel Democratic members\u00a0of Congress have done. It\u2019s a political formula mastered by Democratic presidential predecessors like\u00a0Clinton\u00a0and, in his own way,\u00a0Obama, ahead of their reelection wins: Clinton agreed to compromises with the Republican Congress on\u00a0welfare reform, the Defense of Marriage Act and a range of other issues. Obama, meanwhile, at points in his 2012 campaign touted\u00a0spending austerity,\u00a0deficit reduction\u00a0and extension of George W.\u00a0Bush-era tax cuts.\n        Voters for now are giving Biden\u00a0reasonably good reviews\u00a0for his handling of both Israel and Ukraine. He has a year to make that stick \u2014 a challenging task since most presidential elections since the end of the Cold War have been decided on domestic issues, rather than foreign affairs. Moreover, the situation is volatile, and Biden could end up looking bad if suffering in Gaza increases, a wider war takes place, American forces are killed, there are terror attacks on American soil, or any number of other negative possibilities happen. But Biden, for now, is nailing a key part of the job, just as Clinton and Obama did before him: being presidential.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/opinions/israel-gaza-biden-ukraine-russia-mark/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

I knew that look well.\n        Like him, I\u2019m an Arab, Muslim and American \u2014 an amalgam of identities that conjures up \u201cpariah\u201d in the world we live in. But now, it means something different. At this moment, when\u00a0the horror of mass death unfolds in Gaza\u00a0and on screens we hold in our palms, our identity spells absurdity.\n        We see ourselves in the people of Gaza. The accosted people there share our names, our faith, our culture and our customs. We have friends in that\u00a0140-square-mile\u00a0open-air prison turned into hell on earth, including\u00a0journalists who were sheltering at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital\u00a0at the time of the deadly blast on Wednesday.\n        But what we continue to see on our screens is still half a world away. On the other side of our terrestrial reality and this virtual insanity.\n        Until this past week.\n        \u201cA Palestinian boy was killed in Illinois,\u201d shared Abed. This sequence of foreign-to-domestic murder was a familiar one. Being American, like 6-year-old\u00a0Wadea Al-Fayoume\u00a0was, does not protect us from the stigma of being Palestinian or Arab, Muslim and from the \u201cMiddle East.\u201d Rather, these latter identities keep the security blanket of Americanness away from us, rendering us foreign and, during times of crisis, \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n        Wadea was stabbed 26 times last Saturday with a military-style knife by his family\u2019s landlord, a 71-year-old man who\u2019s been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other crimes. The attacker also stabbed Wadea\u2019s mother more than a dozen times. She\u00a0lived. But what does that word even mean anymore?\n        What does it mean for a mother who escaped war for the safety of an American suburb? What does it mean for Abed and I: an executive director of a civil rights\u00a0organization\u00a0and a law professor, standing at the crosshairs of American power and an Arab identity conflated with terrorism? What does \u201cliving\u201d mean for\u00a0millions of Arabs and Muslimswho call the United States home, burdened with the impossible task of proving their allegiance, over and over again, in response to bellowing demands that bury our humanity?\n        It feels like we are living on borrowed time, like we were extended a contingent citizenship that can be stripped at any time, on account of events that unfold in America or on the other side of the world.\n        Calling it \u201cIslamophobia\u201d would be a severe understatement. This existential ballad of being Arab or Muslim in America is far more onerous, far more absurd. It feels like an existence that has\u00a0no exit. A play where our daily routine is waking up to the news of war, the stark images and videos of slain children, rolling timelines of shattered villages and the roaring demands \u201cto condemn Hamas.\u201d While this plot sounds a lot like novels from Jean Paul Sartre or Albert Camus, this is not fiction.\n        This is our absurd reality.\n        An absurd reality where we, in America, can only post on virtual timelines where the footsteps of suspicion stomp out our voices and censor our speech.\n        Our names and nationalities, faces and faith brand us with the stain of collective guilt for crimes that we did not commit. Moments like this \u2014 like the\u00a0aftermath of 9/11\u00a0or the reckoning after former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0Muslim Ban in 2017\u00a0\u2014 moved many to conceal their ethnicity or\u00a0cover\u00a0their faith, particularly women who removed their hijabs or young children who hid behind aliases. Hate crimes statistics skyrocketed after 9/11, and\u00a0reached\u00a0near proportions in the wake of the Muslim Ban.\u00a0Wadea\u2019s death foreshadows that these figures may spike again, and descend on the heads of Arab and Muslim Americans shadowed by suspicion.\n        But we cannot shed our bodies.\u00a0These are the corporal vehicles that connect us to the victims cast as villains in Gaza. And the symbols that tie us to distant places where \u201cwars on terror\u201d were wrought yesterday and are certain to wreck more lives tomorrow.\n        \u201cMuslims are only newsworthy when villains, never victims.\u201d I wrote those words, for the first time, as a law student weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks. I was much younger then, unprepared for what the world would come to be.\n        But I knew then that it would never be the same.\n        I typed those very eight words 20 years later in my\u00a0book, \u201cThe New Crusades: Islamophobia and the Global War on Muslims.\u201d\u00a0In between the wide-eyed optimism of a young law student and the sobered worldview of an aging law professor, 9/11 and today\u2019s war serve as bookends for morbid middle passages for Muslims in America and around the globe \u2013 as evidenced by the genocidal\u00a0campaigns\u00a0in China, persecution\u00a0in India, hijab and\u00a0abaya\u00a0bans in France, and far more.\u00a0The law and language of Islamophobia\u00a0have been\u00a0exported transnationally by an American \u201cwar on terror\u201d that was first enforced on the home front, upon the heads of Arabs and Muslims like me whose citizenship was cast aside.\n        Being American was no protection. Not then and definitely not now.\n        The barrage of cold stares and commands to condemn terrorism, assignment of collective guilt and characterization of our dead children as \u201ccollateral damage,\u201d not only strips us from the\u00a0substance\u00a0of citizenship, it renders us inhuman. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have ideas,\u201d wrote Carl Jung, \u201cIdeas have people.\u201d\n        And the idea that conflates our skin with terrorism not only grips the imagination of people, but sinks into the very marrow of American gates of power. We must\u00a0exist, whatever that even means anymore, within the very lines that divide our identities and sever us from normalcy.\n        While I am in Washington and not Chicago, I can feel every one of those 26 stabs that plunged into little Wadea\u2019s body. While across American cities large and small,\u00a0we\u00a0see ourselves in the grieving parents forced to bury their dead children in Gaza.\n        This is what it means to be us.\n        Perhaps it is time that this country begins to see us.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/21/opinions/how-arab-muslim-americans-feel-war-beydoun/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

Read\u00a0more opinion\u00a0on CNN.", "body": "      Scrolling through Instagram a few weeks ago,\u00a0a post from The Lily\u00a0stopped us in our tracks. After nearly six years, The Washington Post\u2019s hub for gender and identity coverage \u2014 which featured everything from\u00a0stories\u00a0by staff writer Caroline Kitchener, who would go on to win a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting on abortion after Roe v. Wade, to painfully relatable comics about parenting and friendship\u00a0\u2014 was signing off for good.\n        The announcement was a blow \u2014 not just for fans of The Lily, but for those still mourning The New York Times\u2019 excellent (and now defunct)\u00a0In Her Words newsletter. It\u2019s a discouraging trend: These spaces, beloved by readers, seem to be disappearing\u00a0just as the demand and need for them have never been higher. (Both The Post and The Times cited a desire to integrate gender coverage into broader reporting.)\n        The first so-called \u201cwomen\u2019s pages\u201d appeared in newspapers more than a\u00a0century\u00a0ago; they\u2019ve been a double-edged sword ever since. In the early days, they served up \u201csociety\u201d coverage alongside job opportunities for women reporters. As Sarah Jaffe pointed out in\u00a0Columbia Journalism Review, \u201cwhile reserving a separate space for \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019 meant that things like parenting, fashion, and the beginnings of the feminist movement got column inches, the separation also demarcated the women\u2019s page as the site of less newsy content.\u201d\n        Women journalists, at the time, were acutely aware of the risk of marginalization; more than a few enterprising reporters used this to their advantage, covering everything from war to sports from \u201cthe woman\u2019s angle.\u201d\n        The debate over the so-called \u201cpink ghetto\u201d continues today: Should we celebrate or bemoan the proud history of excellent reproductive health coverage in women\u2019s magazines? What does it mean when a story on equal pay is tagged under \u201cgender\u201d rather than \u201ceconomy\u201d? Is the\u00a0Style\u00a0section really the most natural fit for news of a leadership transition at Planned Parenthood?\u00a0As news outlets chronicle the devastation of the Israel-Hamas war, what will it take to see more mainstream reporting on the disproportionate toll of violent\u00a0conflict\u00a0on women and girls?\u00a0      The issues that affect women\u2019s lives are relevant to people of all genders \u2014 but it\u2019s clear that women\u2019s media outlets still have an essential role to play.\u00a0Ms.\u00a0Magazine was born out of a frustration that, in the words\u00a0of founder Gloria Steinem, \u201cthere really was nothing for women to read that was controlled by women.\u201d More than five decades later, the magazine is still going strong. Blogs like\u00a0Jezebel\u00a0and Feministing\u00a0launched careers, built community and provided a forum to cover issues like\u00a0abortion\u00a0with twice the nuance and none of the \u201cboth sides\u201d false equivalency of \u201cmainstream\u201d media outlets.\n        Many of the same journalists who got their start writing for feminist blogs or women\u2019s magazines (and some who still write for feminist blogs and women\u2019s magazines) are shaping coverage of presidential elections, providing sharp analysis of Supreme Court cases and breaking down complex policy issues for a wide range of platforms. When we see a byline from\u00a0Anna Holmes,\u00a0Erin Gloria Ryan,\u00a0Irin Carmon,\u00a0Jia Tolentino,\u00a0Laura Bassett,\u00a0Mattie Kahn,\u00a0Rebecca Traister,\u00a0Roxane Gay\u00a0or so many others,\u00a0we know we\u2019re in for a smart take on what\u2019s happening in the world.\n        Over the years, it\u2019s been heartening to see coverage of issues like\u00a0reproductive rights,\u00a0paid leave,\u00a0care work\u00a0and the\u00a0#MeToo\u00a0movement begin to make headlines in some of our country\u2019s most prestigious legacy media outlets (and even the occasional\u00a0men\u2019s magazine). It sends a message when a chilling\u00a0story\u00a0about a 13-year-old sexual assault survivor unable to access abortion is on the homepage of TIME, The New York Times spotlights child care\u00a0and\u00a0girlhood, CNN dedicates precious time and resources to investigative\u00a0reporting\u00a0on systemic gender inequality and The Washington Post puts the Black maternal mortality crisis front and\u00a0center.\n        If we\u2019ve seen progress when it comes to moving so-called women\u2019s issues from the margins to the mainstream, it\u2019s thanks in no small part to generations of mostly (though not only) women reporters willing to battle the powers that be, force important stories onto the front page, and insist that women\u2019s news is, well, news. And as thankful as we are to every exhausted reporter continuing to push this particular boulder up the hill, the onus shouldn\u2019t be on them.\n        As media companies compete for readership and fight to stay afloat, appealing to women isn\u2019t just a nice thing to do \u2014 it\u2019s a business imperative. In a 2020\u00a0report,\u00a0\u201cThe Missing Perspectives of Women in News,\u201d researcher Luba Kassova found that \u201cwomen are lighter news consumers than men globally.\u201d She wisely suggests: \u201cThis could be due partly to news being produced mainly by men, and focusing mainly on men \u2013 a problem exacerbated by the data gaps in understanding women\u2019s news needs.\u201d In other words, news outlets have some serious catching up to do when it comes to understanding half their potential audience.\n        In a recent\u00a0viral appearance, comedian Chelsea Handler told Jimmy Fallon: \u201cI think we are in a very important cultural moment, you know, with women dominating culture.\u201d\n        Consider the many articles that popped up this summer analyzing the financial\u00a0ripple effect\u00a0of Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d; Coco Gauff\u2019s\u00a0US Open\u00a0win; and Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9, whose tours together generated more than an estimated\u00a0$9 billion\u00a0in economic activity.\n        Women make up\u00a0slightly more than half\u00a0of the US population, have\u00a0out-voted men\u00a0in every presidential election of the past 60 years and control more than\u00a0$10 trillion\u00a0in household assets. (For more on the role of women in the economy \u2014 and the challenges that persist \u2014 check out the research of newly-minted Nobel Laureate, Claudia Goldin.) In a crowded media landscape, outlets that spend time talking \u2014 and listening \u2014 to women are well-positioned to identify breaking news before it breaks, a reality on vivid display in the days following last summer\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson decision.\n        Heading into a presidential election where abortion will be\u00a0a defining issue\u00a0\u2014 if not\u00a0the\u00a0defining issue \u2014 this is a moment when every media outlet should be racing to expand its gender coverage, not backing away.\n        So what can readers do to encourage this? We can start by holding outlets accountable, demanding that they cover \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d with the rigor they deserve and employ reporters from all backgrounds \u2014 not just for the good of their own coverage but for the sake of our democracy, which benefits from having more voices in the conversation.\n        We can support platforms like The\u00a019th\u00a0News,\u00a0The Meteor\u00a0and\u00a0Rewire News Group, along with smaller independent outlets (we\u2019re big fans\u00a0of Jessica Valenti\u2019s\u00a0Abortion, Every Day). We can champion reporters covering these issues by reading their work and sharing it far and wide. And, of course, let\u2019s not forget that\u00a0publications such as Glamour,\u00a0Cosmopolitan,\u00a0InStyle,\u00a0Teen Vogue,\u00a0Elle,\u00a0Ebony\u00a0and\u00a0Essence\u00a0have long been ahead of the curve in juxtaposing in-depth political and health reporting with stories on fashion and entertainment. (Full disclosure: We have proudly written for, subscribed to, and otherwise supported many of these platforms.)\n        The day The Lily\u00a0posted\u00a0their last Instagram message,\u00a0the comments\u00a0section was awash in heartfelt reflections. \u201cI always read them and used their information in our work of women\u2019s rights activism in Venezuela,\u201d one commenter lamented. Reporters thanked The Lily for giving them their first big byline, or taking a chance on a topic other media outlets had deemed unimportant. \u201cYou guys are making me cry\u00a0\ud83d\ude2d\u00a0Thank you for all you did for young women in journalism\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f,\u201d read one response.\n        There were notes of gratitude for The Lily\u2019s coverage of Black women\u2019s health, LGBTQ families, postpartum anxiety, birth control and a host of other topics too often overlooked by media outlets. One commenter put it succinctly: \u201cThank you so much for seeing us.\u201d\n        That\u2019s the power of great reporting: It can hold a mirror up to society and shine a light on the unseen. The headlines we read help shape politics and public opinion, upend cultural norms and inspire people to act. Ultimately, gender coverage is too important to\u00a0be either/or; it has to be both/and. It matters how these stories are told\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and by whom, and where. We need an abundance of platforms like The Lily, serving as a complement to reporting on gender woven through every section: news, opinion, technology, health, politics, business, the arts. In the interim, wherever outlets place their gender coverage, one thing is clear: We need more of it, not less.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/21/opinions/the-lily-media-women-gender-coverage-richards-peterson/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

We can only hope\u00a0for another perfect score.\n    Correction: This essay has been updated to include the correct Olympic year for the 'Fierce Five.'", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/opinions/mary-lou-retton-gymnastics-virtual-vigil-bass/index.html", "section": "opinions"}
{"title": "      Opinion: I\u2019ve sacrificed for a Hollywood acting career. This is where I draw the line\n    ", "author": "", "published_on": "", "abstract": "Editor\u2019s note: Mehdi Barakchian is a New York-born actor, comedian and producer who has appeared in numerous screen productions. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\u00a0", "body": "      Earlier this month, striking writers ratified a deal with major Hollywood studios that was greeted with excitement throughout the entertainment community. In a year of multiple strikes, it represented a major win for workers fighting growing income inequality.\n        Now, it\u2019s the actors\u2019 turn to reach a deal with studios \u2014 except that the studios have suspended talks with SAG-AFTRA, the union representing us.\n        The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) walked away from the bargaining table on October 11 and studio executives said they were suspending discussions because they were \u201cno longer moving\u201d forward \u201cin a productive direction.\u201d In short, the actors and studios remain in a stalemate.\n        In case you haven\u2019t followed the actors\u2019 strike, the AMPTP and SAG-AFTRA are negotiating revenue sharing and policies around use of artificial intelligence (AI), among other items. Until we get a deal, actors like me remain on the picket lines. And as long as we\u2019re on the picket lines, a lot of great shows won\u2019t be filmed, and a lot of folks who rely on this industry will be out of work.\n        Maybe you\u2019re thinking \u201cwait, I thought actors make tons of money?\u201d Well, sure, it can be millions and millions of dollars \u2014 if you\u2019re an A-lister. Most of us don\u2019t come anywhere close.\n        In my case, you may not know my name, but you might recognize my kind-of-familiar face from one of the shows I\u2019ve appeared in. Some have been pretty big hits over the last five years, including the supernatural drama series \u201cManifest,\u201d the psychological thriller series \u201cYou,\u201d and \u201cModern Love,\u201d an anthology series about human connection.\n        I\u2019m fortunate to have enough success acting full time that I\u2019ve been able to pay my bills and acquire health insurance. Back when my bookings were really booming, I proposed to my now wife and added a dog to our family \u2014 the typical sorts of things people do when they have financial stability.\n        But it\u2019s never been easy for the average actor to afford the conventional trappings of middle-class life \u2014 and it\u2019s getting harder all the time. One big problem for actors is that the business model for Hollywood film productions has completely changed, but the contracts have not. That\u2019s why actors went out on strike in July, a couple of months after the writers did.\n        Suffice to say, my not working for the past few months has been a financial hardship on my family. But the roughly 160,000 actors on strike are enduring what we hope to be a short-term pain for long term gains in pay, benefits and job protection. We miss the profession that we love, but we can\u2019t continue to work in conditions that compensate us less than our due and in an industry that fails to safeguard our careers as it embraces AI in a way that potentially could threaten our livelihoods.\n        A lot of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars are on the picket lines too, lending us their moral support, for which I\u2019m grateful. They are fighting with us for fair wages in an industry where the average salary in 2022 was a paltry $27.73 per hour for actors in California, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. But most actors don\u2019t work a 40-hour work week, 12 months a year, so those stats may not fully capture just how precarious our livelihood is.\n        Acting is a notoriously tough profession to break into and maintain long-term security. Most of us who could were likely able to make a living did so because we were paid a fair wage based on viewership.\n        Prior to the advent of streaming, actors like me relied on residuals paid out based on how often we appeared in a show and how successful it was. That meant essentially, the more views, the more money we earned.\n        But the contracts we are operating under do not consider the dramatic increase in streaming numbers and the decline of network and cable viewership. In short, actors work much more to make ends meet and still sometimes find ourselves earning less.\n        When streaming first showed up, it had a lot of work to do to draw and maintain audiences. At the time, most of us were working in cable and network TV, which is where the audiences were. That large viewership, and the usage residuals this model provided, is why a lot of us were able to make a living. But the business has completely changed.\n        Last year, streaming in the US surpassed cable and network TV in viewership. Many actors depend on residuals from previous programs but in the streaming era, that income has fallen precipitously.      This immense shift has changed the model, and the AMPTP, which represents movie and television producers, including Disney, Warner Brothers and Netflix (CNN\u2019s parent company is Warner Bros. Discovery, which produces movies and television shows.) And even as studios say that they\u2019re being squeezed financially, CEOs continue to earn tens of millions of dollars.\n        Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA says 86% of its members don\u2019t qualify for health care coverage through the union, because they don\u2019t qualify under SAG-AFTRA\u2019s income threshold, which is about $26,500 a year.\n        What\u2019s more, many of us live in the most expensive cities in the country like Los Angeles and New York, because that\u2019s where the work and industry infrastructure exists. The average one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles rents for about $3,000 per month, according to rent.com, which comes to $36,000 per year. So, if you\u2019re a Hollywood actor barely scraping by \u2014 well, you can do the math.\n        Another major sticking point is how the industry would like to use AI. The AI proposal from the AMPTP impacts the most marginalized and financially vulnerable performers in the entertainment industry \u2014 background actors.\n        Obviously, the way in which actors\u2019 images will be used is a hugely important issue. SAG-AFTRA negotiators say the proposed contract would pay background actors for a day\u2019s work (they currently are paid at the rate of less than $200 per day), scan their body and use that image any way they want for the rest of the project. The union has also said that the studios want to own that scan to use for perpetuity, without the consent of the background actor and without providing further compensation. The AMPTP rejected this claim, and has said that they will require consent from the actor and the replica would only be used in the movie they signed up for.\n        But here\u2019s a sobering thought: AI technology is still incredibly young. We have no way of understanding or knowing what can be done with this information in 10, 20, or 30 years. The potential is limitless and protections for real people need to be put in place now.\n        You might be thinking, \u201cWith all your reservations about the way the business of Hollywood is run, why don\u2019t you just get a different job?\u201d I\u2019d turn the question around and ask you, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you fight for the job you love?\u201d\n        Acting is my job. It\u2019s more than that \u2013 it\u2019s my passion. I\u2019ve done thousands of auditions, performed thousands of hours on stage to hone my craft, finished hundreds of hours of really mediocre improv classes (and some good ones too) and made a cross-country move away from everyone and everything I know to pursue this career.\n        I think a lot of people were reminded of the value of on-screen entertainment in their lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. The stories we watched on big and small screens gave us something else to talk about \u2014 a way to escape the scary reality just outside our front door.\n        Several Hollywood A-listers, including Ben Affleck, Emma Stone and George Clooney, met with SAG-AFTRA leaders this week after the studios suspended negotiations. They\u2019ve made overtures to try to end the strike, according to news reports; I\u2019m hoping that all that star power helps get the talks back on track. The idea that underpaid union workers should \u201cget a different job\u201d while industry executives earn tens of millions of dollars feels like a post-apocalyptic show written by AI. But here we are \u2014 in real life.\n        Let\u2019s be clear: this fight is about the entire ecosystem that makes your favorite onscreen entertainment run. This includes actors like me, but also casting directors, costume departments, lighting crews, camera operators, producers, teamsters, make-up artists and so many more professionals with real lives, real families and real professional goals. None of us non-executives\u00a0 get rich working in this industry.\n        I couldn\u2019t be happier for my extended family in the Writers Guild of America whose sacrifice and determination allowed them to strike a deal with the studio execs that their leaders are happy with. Until the actors can say the same, you won\u2019t find my kind-of-familiar face on screen, but on the picket line.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/opinions/hollywood-actors-movies-strike-talks-sag-aftra-barakchian/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

The opinions expressed here are her own. Read\u00a0more opinion\u00a0at CNN.", "body": "      When Sidney Powell famously threatened to \u201crelease the kraken,\u201d she surely meant something different than what has come to pass.\n        Having failed to keep former President Donald Trump in the White House through allegedly illegal schemes to overturn the 2020 election results, leading to\u00a0criminal charges\u00a0in Georgia, Powell has released\u00a0herself\u00a0from the case by\u00a0pleading guilty\u00a0to six misdemeanor offenses and agreeing to testify truthfully against her codefendants as part of her plea deal.\n        Powell\u2019s testimony is hugely important and her plea is a big breakthrough for prosecutors. She is the first cooperating witness who was part of the limited group that met with Trump to craft the plans to overthrow the election. She was also present at an\u00a0infamous meeting\u00a0at the White House on December 18, 2020 that devolved into a screaming match.\n        To date, outside advisers like Powell, who supported\u00a0plans to seize voting machines,\u00a0among other things,\u00a0had maintained\u00a0in subpoenaed testimony that\u00a0their actions were justified.\n        The existence of the plea deal suggests her testimony at trial will be different \u2014\u00a0and that Georgia prosecutors are not only convinced that it is credible and reliable, but also that it can help them convict other defendants in the case.\n        As a result, Powell\u2019s plea could be devastating for Trump and her other former co-defendants in the Georgia election interference case. Her testimony could potentially play a significant role in the federal election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith as well.\n        The most immediate impact of Powell\u2019s plea is likely to be felt\u00a0by her co-defendants in the Georgia case, starting with\u00a0Kenneth Chesebro, the alleged architect of the fake electors\u2019 plot, whose trial starts next week.\u00a0Chesebro reportedly\u00a0rejected\u00a0a recent plea offer, according to sources who spoke to ABC;\u00a0perhaps he may reconsider now that Powell has pleaded and is prepared to testify.\n        It\u2019s not entirely clear, however, that prosecutors would use Powell\u2019s testimony at Chesebro\u2019s trial, given that the indictment does not allege that they were involved together in any specifically charged actions. Prosecutors could choose to focus more intently on the parts of the conspiracy involving Chesebro\u2014namely, the scheme to convene alternate slates of electors to be used to disrupt the election certification process.\n        Powell\u2019s cooperation is also very bad news for two other groups of defendants in the Georgia case. The lower-level defendants indicted over their actions in Coffee County, Georgia, should be very concerned about proceeding to trial with a second cooperating witness now on board, after Scott Hall, a Georgia bail bondsman\u00a0reached a plea deal\u00a0in September.\n        But more critically, Powell\u2019s interactions with Trump and his inner circle mean that the most important names at the top of the indictment \u2014 particularly Trump, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani \u2014\u00a0could be directly implicated by her potential testimony.\n        Truthful testimony by Powell should include her involvement in the plans to steal the 2020 election through false public statements, frivolous litigation, the seizure of voting machines\u00a0and the sidelining of Trump\u2019s actual legal advisers in favor of Powell and others willing to do whatever it took to succeed.\n        Powell\u2019s testimony should also include what Trump, Meadows, Giuliani and others said in meetings and other interactions in which the plot and its execution were discussed. This insider\u2019s view was something that had been previously missing, and it will likely be devastating at trial.\n        Many of Powell\u2019s past statements have been egregiously false \u2014 like\u00a0baseless claims\u00a0that the Clinton Foundation, philanthropist George Soros, and former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez were responsible for manipulating voting machines to change the results \u2014 and her connection to a key figure in the QAnon conspiracy world\u00a0must have been troubling to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis\u2019s team as they thought about her as a government witness.\n        That suggests to me that, for prosecutors to sign this deal and have confidence in Powell as a witness, Powell must have fully conceded that her prior positions were baseless and false and that she will come clean about that on the stand.\n        Powell was identified as an\u00a0unnamed co-conspirator\u00a0in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment \u2014 which means that a charge in that case may be coming.\n        If that comes to pass, it is unclear whether Powell would cooperate in that case. Just because she struck a plea deal with Willis\u2019 office doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she will do the same in the federal election interference case.\n        But the fact that Powell cooperated in Georgia does make it more likely that she will try to cooperate with Smith in exchange for some sort of deal.\u00a0 Once someone gets over the hurdle of the first guilty plea, they are much more likely to resolve other matters similarly.\n        But if federal prosecutors do charge Powell, they will be able to use Powell\u2019s plea statements and any testimony\u00a0from the Georgia case against her, leaving her with few options to fight a federal case if it is brought.\n        At a minimum, federal prosecutors will have more information to decide what to do about Powell and how to proceed, which can only help them as they move toward Trump\u2019s\u00a0March 2024\u00a0trial date.\n        Powell\u2019s legal troubles are not over. She still faces potential jeopardy in the federal election interference case,\u00a0as well as major lawsuits by\u00a0two voting\u00a0machine companies, There have\u00a0also been\u00a0efforts\u00a0to sanction or disbar her in jurisdictions in which she filed and litigated frivolous lawsuits and made defamatory claims, which may gain steam following her guilty plea.\n        But she has limited the damage to herself in Georgia, while at the same time providing prosecutors with a major weapon in their efforts to hold the rest of the defendants, including former President Trump, accountable for their conduct.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/opinions/sidney-powells-plea-is-bad-news-for-trump-rodgers/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

Couldn\u2019t a film about old dads also have included some older moms?\n        Look, being an older dad is not a new story: Men have been doing it since the\u00a0dawn of time. The biblical Abraham was 100 years old when he had Isaac. More recently,\u00a0Robert De Niro\u00a0was 79 when he announced the birth of his seventh child.\u00a0Al Pacino\u00a0was 83 when he had his fourth. Talk about \u201cThe Godfather\u201d\u2026.\n        Our culture is long overdue for some\u00a0real-talk\u00a0storytelling about older moms, because we\u2019re the\u00a0true heroes of any story about older parenting. We older moms are the only demographic increasing fertility: From 1990 to 2019,\u00a0the number of\u00a0women\u00a0ages 40 to 44\u00a0giving birth more than doubled, and women 35 to 39 saw a 67% increase, according to\u00a0the United States Census Bureau. (Women in age groups under 30 also showed a startling decrease in that time period.)\n        Like many older moms, it wasn\u2019t exactly my\u00a0first choice to\u00a0become a parent later in life: I only met my future husband at 39, and we didn\u2019t get married until I was 41. I got pregnant right away \u2014 and if I hadn\u2019t kept miscarrying for the next three years, I still would have been an older mom, just not quite as old as I was when I birthed our daughter at age 44.\n        Living in New York City, I didn\u2019t feel old being a first-time mom in my 40s \u2014 but that\u2019s because my sister and best friends also had babies at the same time (fine, they were approaching 40 and I was well past it, but still.) It\u2019s true that some people called me \u201cGrandma\u201d \u2014 an unfortunate rite of passage for all us over-40 moms, especially those not living in\u00a0big, coastal cities. But I just laughed it off.\n        What I can\u2019t laugh at is that we older mothers get so much aggravation for having children later in life.\u00a0\u201cShould we be sympathetic to a 42-year-old\u2019s fertility struggles?\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s how a writer came at me on a parenting website when I started to share my IVF journey in a weekly\u00a0column\u00a0ten years ago. Commenters weren\u2019t kind either, writing things like,\u00a0\u201cYour [sic] old and dried up,\u201d one woman wrote. \u201cAmy\u2019s journey seems to be all about herself and her needs,\u201d another opined about my wanting to be a mother.\n        That\u2019s because the narrative about older moms is that we\u2019re selfish.\u00a0 Not that we haven\u2019t found a partner, or we\u2019re trying to get out of debt to afford a child or we are having trouble getting pregnant. (Forget the fact that,\u00a0according to some studies,\u00a0sperm counts are declining.)\n        But older dads \u2014 no matter if they\u2019re octogenarians \u2014 are rarely called selfish or \u201cdried up.\u201d In \u201cOld Dads,\u201d Burr\u2019s character Jack doesn\u2019t get\u00a0grief\u00a0for being old. \u201cI always wanted to be a dad,\u201d he narrates\u00a0at\u00a0the beginning of the film, noting that it took him 46 years to\u00a0get there.\u00a0(In real life,\u00a0Burr\u00a0was 49 and 52 when he had his daughter and son.) If anyone asks Jack why it took him so long, he says, \u201cI tell them to F@#$ off.\u201d\n        Rarely can a woman tell the world to go jump in the proverbial lake. As the \u201cBarbie\u201d\u00a0movie has shown us, women usually have to apologize for our very existence (and in America Ferrera\u2019s\u00a0memorable monologue\u00a0about the challenges and misogynist traps women face, she did not even begin to discuss older moms.) When people call us selfish, or career-oriented (as if we shouldn\u2019t be working?) or blame us for our own infertility (!), we women just have to shoulder it.\n        We don\u2019t have the luxury like the men in \u201cOld Dads,\u201d such as Jack, who says he married late because, \u201cI just hadn\u2019t met the right woman yet.\u201d That\u2019s because it\u2019s okay for men to be picky in finding a partner or to focus on their careers or in fact be selfish (it\u2019s called \u201cambition\u201d for men). His wife in the film (played by Katie Aselton) believes he married late because \u201che had an unhappy childhood.\u201d\n        Hey, I had an unhappy childhood! Raised in a home with traditional gender norms before my parents ultimately divorced, I wasn\u2019t eager to take on the labor of motherhood \u2014 birthing, raising and loving kids, not to mention cooking, cleaning and planning for them, too. Like Jack, I also was a late bloomer, but as he says, \u201cI\u2019m not going to whine about it.\u201d\n        Truthfully, I don\u2019t have much\u00a0reason\u00a0to whine about being an older mother. I love it.\n        I\u2019m grateful I had my 30s to make the mistakes in dating to not have to settle; I kissed enough frogs before I met my love, an equal partner who does his share of the childcare, work\u00a0and\u00a0housework. (Like Burr, my husband was 49 when we had our daughter, but he looks half his age, and acts like it, too.)\n        I\u2019m lucky that I had time to work out my issues so I don\u2019t have to burden my kids with unresolved psychological scars. And unlike many women who have children in their 20s and early 30s, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m missing out on anything: We older moms have had more time for\u00a0travel, for climbing the corporate ladder (or whatever ladder we\u2019re on). We have invested in ourselves, and\n        are now more than ready to devote ourselves to our children and families.\n        The main problem with being an older mom \u2014 or older parent \u2014 is that we\u2019ll have less time to be with our children. But nothing is ever guaranteed; my best friend, a mom of two, died at 42, so you never know.\u00a0The topics of aging and death\u00a0aren\u2019t\u00a0addressed in \u201cOld Dads,\u201d\u00a0which ends with the old guys being forced to change with the changing times.\n        This one movie\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0bear\u00a0the responsibility for addressing all the shortcomings of how we talk about older parenting, but I wish\u00a0it\u00a0addressed the lessons we older moms (and dads, my husband wanted me to add) can teach the younger generation: most importantly, to not take parenting (or ourselves) too seriously, that our children will probably be okay (look at how little parenting we Gen Xers got!) and that life and parenting are precious, no matter how old you are.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/19/opinions/old-dads-netflix-bill-burr-older-moms-klein/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

He is the author of The Dead Pledge: The Origins of the Mortgage Market and Federal Bailouts, 1913-1939. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more\u00a0CNN Opinion.", "body": "      Anyone looking to buy a house knows that this is not a great time. During the pandemic, mortgage rates were at their lowest level in\u00a0history\u00a0and housing was cheaper. It took just about 20% of the median family income to pay for a mortgage with 20% down. Today, mortgage interest rates are up \u2014 the\u00a030-year fixed rate\u00a0is currently 7.63%\u00a0\u2014 and so are home prices. Americans need about\u00a035%\u00a0of their income to pay for a mortgage, which is higher than at the peak of the so-called housing bubble in the early 2000s.\n        Unfortunately for homebuyers, there is almost no hope that we\u2019ll return to the affordable housing days of 2020. More concerning, there is little indication that recent trends will reverse or that homebuying will get much more affordable in the near future.\n        The main reason homebuyers are struggling is that the cost of borrowing has gone up for everybody. After a burst of inflation, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates at one of the fastest paces in its history. The Fed has taken its target\u00a0interest rate\u00a0from near zero at the beginning of 2022 to almost 5.5%\u00a0today.\n        But the Fed\u2019s rates mainly affect short-term borrowing. Even more important for mortgages are long-term interest rates that recently hit peaks.\n        One of the main reasons for those higher long-term rates is unprecedented levels of federal deficits and debt. This year the federal\u00a0deficit, excluding the reversal of the government\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan, hit\u00a0$2 trillion, a level once inconceivable in peacetime. The Fed has also been\u00a0reducing\u00a0its holdings of many long-term federal bonds and even\u00a0mortgage-backed securities\u00a0backed by the federal government. These trillions of dollars of bonds thrown on the market mean all sorts of borrowers have to compete for funds in a more crowded field, and therefore have to pay higher interest rates to attract investors\u2019 attention.\n        The markets are expecting the federal government to keep begging for large slugs of extra cash for years, which has helped push 10-year Treasury notes up to over\u00a04.9%, from below 1% just a few years ago. The increased interest rates for federal and other debt have pushed mortgage rates up from less than 3% during the pandemic to 7.63%.\n        In another world, high mortgage rates might have crashed the housing market and at least reduced prices for new homebuyers. But, according to the Case-Shiller Home Price Index, although\u00a0housing prices\u00a0declined a bit after a temporary peak last year, they have started\u00a0climbing\u00a0again and even hit new record highs. The median\u00a0sales price\u00a0of a house in the middle of this year was about $420,000, almost $100,000 higher than it was before the pandemic and far above its peak in the early 2000s.\n        The problem is that even though higher interest rates have not reduced home prices, they have stalled homebuilding and new house listings.\u00a0Due in part to increased financing costs, new housing construction this year will likely be\u00a0down\u00a0about 10% from its post-pandemic peak. And few people are putting their houses on the\u00a0market, since they want to keep their old, lower\u00a0mortgage rates. The lack of supply is keeping housing prices elevated.\n        The current situation amounts to a tragedy for new homebuyers. They have few housing options, and the options they do have are at new price peaks and have to be purchased with high-interest mortgages.\n        There is little sign that the driving forces behind these problems will turn around soon. Inflation is still high, so the Fed doesn\u2019t want to reduce interest rates or start repurchasing bonds in the next few months, which would drive down rates; the federal government will not get its fiscal house in order in the next few years; and there is little indication that homebuilders are ready to significantly ramp up construction again. The Mortgage Bankers Association\u00a0expects\u00a0mortgage rates will start coming down within a year, but it has had to keep revising its expectations for rates upwards.\n        Homebuyers in general should not try to time the market. If we\u2019ve learned anything in the past two decades, it\u2019s that housing prices can go up and down unexpectedly. But for those who don\u2019t have to buy right now, renting should be considered an option. Despite claims to the contrary, homebuying is not always a better financial decision than renting. Since rents have started coming\u00a0down, a comfortable rental home can be a great alternative when buying is unaffordable.\n        For those who are looking to buy, the best short-term hope is that economic and financial headwinds start to push home prices down again. Lower prices would allow homebuyers to secure high-interest mortgages now and then hope to refinance when or if rates go down again in the future. It might be slim comfort, but it is one of the few things for which potential homebuyers, including this writer, can hope.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/19/opinions/housing-market-mortgage-rates-glock/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

In this world of perpetual darkness\u00a0\u2014\u00a0largely devoid of electricity, fuel, and the internet\u00a0\u2014\u00a0my family has\u00a0now also receded from view.\n        In the northern reaches of Gaza, over 20 members of my extended family seek shelter under the refuge of a staircase\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a frail shield against the relentless and merciless storm of airstrikes.\n        They tread cautiously, avoiding windows and the desolate streets where the overwhelming stench of death, fire and chaos hangs heavy in the air.\n        When ambulances, fire departments, journalists and\u00a0UN staff find themselves bereft of protection, one can only imagine the plight of civilians like my family and dear friends in Gaza this week.\n        The negative impact of this war on my family in Gaza is hard to overstate: hospitals running out of space for the dead and injured, pushing the local hospitals to\u00a0use ice cream trucks to preserve the bodies.      Hungry cats roam the streets of Gaza crying for food.\n        And if this is not enough, our family in Gaza received a\u00a0prank evacuation call last night. It\u2019s deeply distressing to hear that in these difficult times, some are making prank calls to Palestinians in Gaza, urging them to evacuate their homes in the middle of the night under the pretense of impending bombings.\n        This has caused immense panic and fear for many families. Such actions are both heartless and unnecessary, particularly when thousands of homes have already been destroyed in Gaza.\n        We once celebrated birthdays together, shared meals, laughed and forged cherished memories.\u00a0Yet today those memories lay in ruins, much like the places that were once our sanctuaries.\n        My family, like countless others, is denied the simple privilege of reminiscing about better days as they endure another judgment day.\n        My 71-year-old mother, surrounded by most of her children and their offspring, clings to the familial bond that keeps them together as they grapple with diminishing water supplies, and the oppressive cloak of darkness that accompanies a life without electricity.\n        Their peculiar predicament places them in what is ironically deemed northern Gaza\u2019s evacuation area, though escape remains a risky endeavor for many.\n        The reasons for their inability to flee are multifaceted. The scarcity of fuel renders any vehicle moving in Gaza right now\u00a0\u2014\u00a0let alone a car spacious enough to accommodate 20 people\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a subject of suspicion. And venturing southward would lead them into unfamiliar territory, far from friends, family and the comforting familiarity of home. In a region where geography can determine life or death, this is a gamble few are willing to take.\n        In a world where not even\u00a0my\u00a0colleagues adorned with the emblem of the UN are assured safety, the conundrum faced by civilians becomes a disquieting paradox.\u00a0How can ordinary Palestinians, like my family, be expected to find sanctuary when the lines between refuge and peril blur with each passing day?\n        The struggles of the present serve as a testament to the unyielding spirit of the Palestinian people, a resilience that draws its strength from the painful memories of\u00a01948\u00a0when my grandparents fled for their lives, and\u00a01967\u00a0when our parents sought shelter within Gaza.\n        These were times of similar adversity, times when our forebears endured and survived. The question that lingers, however, is why should their children and grandchildren be condemned to relive this ceaseless cycle of suffering?\n        Looking back at those days, I have developed a deeper understanding of my relatives, who lived through the\u00a01948 Nakba\u00a0\u2013 and the uncertainty, the injustices, the powerlessness and the betrayal. Feelings instilled into a new generation of Palestinians who only grew up hearing stories\u00a0of their ethnic cleansing.\n        Now the Palestinians in Gaza\u00a0are taking a trip down memory lane, with the realization in their march toward safety,\u00a0that\u00a0they are leaving behind places that they might as well never see again.\n        The pain of loss and dispossession has been etched into our collective memory, serving as a somber and persistent reminder of our shared history.\n        Earlier this week, I received a message from Amro, my 29-year-old nephew. Amro is fond of Gaza and staying there, despite having opportunities to travel and live outside of it.\n        Amro made me promise that\u00a0if\u00a0he somehow survives this, I should help him find a way to leave Gaza forever. This was hard for me. Amro loved this coastal Mediterranean town, up until the most recent war.\n        This essay serves as a heartfelt plea for understanding, compassion, and, above all, an urgent call for peace and the hope of a brighter future.\n        Sadly, given the relentless duration of the crisis in Gaza, the prospects for such a future seem more elusive by the second.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/19/opinions/palestinian-american-family-gaza-fears-almadhoun/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

There have been plenty of opinion pieces in national outlets, with headlines like \u201cThe War Comes to Stanford\u201d and \u201cStudents for Pogroms in Israel.\u201d\n        But there have also been more material criticisms. After several Harvard student groups announced that they \u201chold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence\u201d following the Hamas attack on the country that left at least 1,500 dead, billionaire hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman and others\u00a0called for the students\u2019 names and details to be made publicly available in order\u00a0to blacklist them from future jobs \u2014 essentially also calling for them to be doxxed. A nonprofit founded by Victoria\u2019s Secret billionaire Leslie Wexner, and his wife Abigail, announced that it was\u00a0breaking ties with Harvard, alleging the school has been \u201ctiptoeing\u201d over the Hamas\u2019 attack.\n        At the University of Pennsylvania, the Huntsman Foundation (led by former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman)\u00a0withdrew\u00a0its promised multimillion-dollar donations this week, arguing that the university\u2019s delay in commenting on the attack amounted to \u201csilence in the face of reprehensible and historic Hamas evil.\u201d And as Huntsman, also a former ambassador and former Penn trustee, wrote in his email to Penn\u2019s president, \u201csilence is antisemitism.\u201d\n        Historical context matters here, because harsh reactions among the American establishment to college students and their political activism are not new to the current crisis. Student radicals have been targets of condemnation since at least the early 1960s, when they experimented with new forms of protest against anti-Black racism, the Vietnam War, poverty and censorship. \u201cI think they oughta shoot \u2018em if they\u2019re carrying the Vietcong flag,\u201d actor John Wayne\u00a0said of the protests.\n        Though they were part of pivotal movements for social change, the students themselves wielded much less power than most other people in society \u2014 certainly less than politicians, business leaders and university presidents. So why do these students receive such outsized attention?\n        In part, no doubt, it\u2019s a question of fear: fear that a rising generation will fundamentally transform the country, rewriting its politics in ways that appall the people currently in power. That has yet to bear out in reality; the 1980s and 1990s, for instance, were not decades of left-wing radicalism by middle-aged Boomers (many of whom had fought the Vietnam War), but rather an era of marked conservatism in US politics. There were, of course, cultural changes, but on the political front, it would have been difficult to guess that, say, the Democratic Party that voted for the Iraq invasion in 2003 had, 30 years earlier, been torn apart by antiwar protesters opposed to US actions in Vietnam.\n        It\u2019s fair (and important) to note that the students being criticized now for their protests are by far in the minority of their peers,\u00a0in part because\u00a0social media and news outlets have highlighted the most incendiary and shocking voices, muting the more nuanced discussions that define many of the conversations and positions held by student activists.\u00a0But watching this all play out in recent days, it seems like there is a more important dynamic at play, a different lesson derived from the 1960s. People with real power have learned, over the decades and most acutely in the last few years, to use student protests and youth-driven radicalism as a political tool, pointing to the content of protests to delegitimize entire parties and movements.\n        Students can be at times ham-fisted, doctrinaire, blinkered and strident in their protest. In the 1960s, student radicals\u00a0occasionally waved the Viet Cong flag to show solidarity with the people of Vietnam. Others flashed the Little Red Book of Mao Zedong, a Chinese leader whose policies led to millions of deaths. Such symbols became important touchstones for some students who were working to make sense of, and oppose, American imperialism, a political stance with few other outlets in the US (certainly\u00a0the two-party system had little to offer them).\n        Such techniques also made students tempting targets at a time when US soldiers were dying in firefights with the Viet Cong, and when sympathy for the millions of Vietnamese killed or displaced by the war was hard to find. An\u00a0image of a student with a Viet Cong flag\u00a0allowed supporters of the war to argue that the entire antiwar movement was actually anti-American. As a bonus, the sight of such students made it easy to dismiss young people across the country, and leftism more broadly, as uninformed, unpatriotic and unworthy of support, without ever having to engage with the students\u2019 critiques of American power.\n        There was no need to engage, because the students themselves had little power of their own. Universities could, and\u00a0did,\u00a0suspend and expel\u00a0student protesters. Police could, and did,\u00a0brutalize and arrest\u00a0them. Political parties could, and did,\u00a0ignore and overrule them (although the Democratic Party would ultimately reform its practices to allow greater representation of young people, a reform that did not dramatically change the party\u2019s politics in the years that followed).\n        But students did have the power to disrupt,\u00a0to grab camera time and to create\u00a0the iconic imagery of an era. For that reason, it was easy to imagine they had far more power than they did, easy for people with actual power and material resources to imagine themselves to be victims of these students. President Richard Nixon invoked\u00a0the \u201csilent majority\u201d in 1969, suggesting that US politics had been hijacked by the unruly, unrepresentative protestors that dominated the nightly news, that patriotic Americans had to take their country back. President Ronald Reagan\u00a0railed against\u00a0student protestors as governor of California in the late 1960s, building himself a platform to eventually become president. The students may not have gotten their revolution, but conservative politicians found them useful for gaining power of their own.\n        A similar dynamic appears alive and well today.\u00a0Students at a number of schools across the US have rallied for Palestinians, at times blaming Israel for Hamas\u2019 attack as part of a broader denunciation of the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza.\u00a0Critics in particular\u00a0have called out\u00a0National Students for Justice in Palestine for its \u201cday of resistance\u201d that explicitly celebrated the attacks and sought to lay blame for the violence entirely on Israel.\u00a0That position is offensive for most, especially for fellow students who may rightly feel alienated or horrified by their colleagues\u2019 efforts, but nothing coming from US universities has, at this point, moved the needle on national\u00a0support for Israel, which\u00a0appears to be strengthening.\n        But it has earned many students swift retribution, in the form of\u00a0lost jobs, broad condemnation and the threat of industry blacklists. It has also been used to discredit the left more broadly. For some, that\u2019s precisely the point. Christopher Rufo, a right-wing activist who has built a career on attacking universities (and for explaining in detail how he carries out his propaganda),\u00a0laid out his plan\u00a0on social media, arguing that, by connecting Hamas, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Socialists of America and academic discourse, the right can \u201cattack, delegitimize and discredit\u201d universities and the American left, turning them into \u201cpolitical untouchables.\u201d\n        Such a maneuver requires most Americans to believe that students have outsized power, that they have the potential to orchestrate the nation\u2019s politics and so must be shut down at any costs by those who disagree with these students\u2019 political causes.\u00a0That simply isn\u2019t the case. You may hate these student activists\u2019 words and actions, but they\u2019re not the ones with the power here. We should be focused on the people who do have that power, and on how they\u2019re using it.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/opinions/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-college-student-protests-hemmer/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

Speaking to me on Sunday, Hroub also said that\u00a0Israel\u2019s expected ground invasion of Gaza\u00a0doesn\u2019t seem to incorporate any planning for the \u201cday after\u201d the war is over.\n        Hroub was born in Bethlehem in the West Bank in a refugee camp, and his\u00a0family moved to Jordan and then to the UK, where he completed his doctorate at the University of Cambridge. He is a professor of Middle Eastern studies at\u00a0Northwestern University\u2019s campus\u00a0in Doha, Qatar.\n        Hroub told me he believes that\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0in Lebanon on Israel\u2019s northern border will not get involved in the war in a large-scale way unless the Gaza conflict drags on for many weeks. If it does, he said, the pressure on Hezbollah to fight Israel will increase.\n  Our interview was edited for length and clarity.Peter Bergen: What do you think about the scale and timing of the Hamas attack in Israel?Khaled Hroub:\u00a0My analysis is Hamas did not plan this attack to be as large as it was. I think they planned something limited; they wanted to do something short, swift and effective.\n        They had been planning for this for a long time, but once they penetrated Israel, they were surprised by the ease of the operation. The operation spread in different directions without prior planning.\n        Once the operation became larger than planned, it appeared that there was no clear second phase to this Hamas operation. There was no clear-cut political goal or demand behind it. So, it looked like an ad hoc expansion of what had started to be the kidnapping of some Israeli soldiers and then swapping them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. They were surprised by their own success.\n  Bergen: So, who\u2019s in charge of Hamas\u2019 operations? Is it\u00a0Mohammed Deif, an elusive Hamas military commander?Hroub:\u00a0It is hard to tell because the media focuses on\u00a0Mohammed Deif, but Hamas has\u00a0a collective leadership\u00a0at the end of the day.\n        Israeli policy seems to target these Hamas leaders, thinking they are solely responsible. So, if we assassinate this guy or that guy, things will be dramatically different. Over the years, this theory has been proven wrong. So, the more the\u00a0Israelis assassinate Hamas leaders, the more a new generation comes in, even younger and maybe even more radical.\n  Bergen: You said in the past that when Israel undertook previous large-scale military operations in Gaza, it backfired because\u00a0it strengthened Hamas. Do you think that situation is going to be different this time?Hroub:\u00a0I think neither Israel nor Hamas had a very clear plan for what happens down the road. Even if the Israeli military succeeded in destroying Hamas, the question facing everyone is, what\u2019s next?\n        So instead of having one single address now in Gaza that you can deter \u2014 Hamas does have institutions \u2014 you will end up with a bunch of splinter groups, certainly more radical than Hamas, and without any method of deterring them. So, this is why I think Israel doesn\u2019t have a clear plan for the second phase of whatever invasion they might do.\n  Bergen:\u00a0The 2006 Palestinian elections\u00a0were won by Hamas.\u00a0The George W. Bush administration\u00a0had encouraged that election but was surprised by Hamas\u2019 success. What was the\u00a0impact of that election?\u00a0Hroub:\u00a0I think it led to the situation that we are facing at this very moment. Why is this? If you go back to the context, the regional and global atmosphere back then was dominated by the so-called war on terror, led by George Bush. This war was fought in countries and against groups, including Hamas.\n        The other campaign of George Bush\u2019s administration was the region\u2019s democratization. So, these two efforts were going hand in hand for the Bush administration: One was the democratization of the Middle East, and the other was the campaign against terrorism.\n        So, Hamas used the Bush democratization campaign to protect itself from the heat of the war on terror, and they won the 2006 elections and\u00a0came into power in Gaza.\n  Bergen: Why did Hamas win the elections in 2006?Hroub:\u00a0Hamas\u2019 victory in 2006 was not only the appeal of Hamas; it was the failure of the PLO and the Palestinian Authority in delivering\u00a0their promises of having a Palestinian state.\n        Israel also did not fulfill its promises to the Palestinians, and there was no hope. Even Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Yitzhak\u00a0Rabin, who signed the\u00a01993 Oslo peace accords\u00a0moving forward the\u00a0peace process,\u00a0was assassinated by an Israeli. And since then, you have\u00a0right-wing politics dominating\u00a0the Israeli scene. So that was another kind of failure.\u00a0      A third party that failed was the US. The US did not care about\u00a0the perspective of the Palestinians. These multiple failures fed into the popularity of Hamas.\n        Palestinian voters also hated the corruption of the Palestinian Authority and its failure in bringing about a Palestinian state, and they wanted an alternative: Hamas,\u00a0which was seen as not corrupt\u00a0and also adhering to resistance against Israel.\n        Now the image is different, of course, because Hamas has been in power for 16 years, and people have\u00a0mixed views about Hamas\u2019 performance.\n  Bergen: What is the role of religion in Hamas?Hroub:\u00a0Very central, the mother organization of Hamas is the\u00a0Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood, which was founded in Jerusalem in 1945. During the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and most of the 1980s, they did the business of any other traditional branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, meaning working in charities, mosques, student unions and professional associations.\n        But they never adopted a resistance strategy against Israel, which meant that during this period, they had a dubious reputation among the Palestinians because they were not resisting Israel.\n        What changed was the gradual Islamization of Palestinian society, and in 1987, when the\u00a0first Palestinian uprising happened, they changed their strategy and adopted resistance.\n        Since then, we have had these two tendencies within\u00a0Hamas. One is nationalist; the other is religious. In times of crisis and war, the religious component comes to the forefront at the expense of the political and nationalist components.\n  Bergen:\u00a0US Secretary of State\u00a0Antony\u00a0Blinken\u00a0was in the Qatari capital, Doha, last week. The Qatari government has a relationship with Hamas and has also had success in brokering deals\u00a0to get hostages and prisoners released; for instance,\u00a0five Americans held by Iran were released\u00a0last month. Do you think there\u2019s some possibility there, or is the war too advanced for that discussion to happen in a meaningful way?\u00a0Hroub:\u00a0I think it\u2019s still kind of very early to talk seriously about this issue. Hamas will be very stubborn because the only concrete outcome that could come from this confrontation is to free Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. And this doesn\u2019t fit with the mood nowadays dominating Israel. So, I think it\u2019s a bit too early.\n  Bergen: Do you think Hezbollah stays on the sidelines mostly during the war against Hamas, or that can change?Hroub:\u00a0Hezbollah may get involved the longer the war goes on. If it goes on for three, four weeks, things might change.\n  Bergen: Is peace at all possible here in the longer term?\u00a0Hroub:\u00a0Since the killing of Rabin, the idea of\u00a0a two-state solution on the Israeli side\u00a0has been continuously going down the drain.\n  Bergen: What happens to those living in Gaza?Hroub:\u00a0There are many kinds of local voices calling upon\u00a0the Palestinians not to leave Gaza, telling them, \u201cIf you leave, you will never come back.\u201d\u00a0The Arab countries\u00a0are extremely sensitive to taking more Palestinians into their territories, whether in Egypt or Jordan.\n  Bergen: Do you think this Hamas attack on Israel was an intelligence failure or a policy failure by the Israelis, or both?Hroub:\u00a0I think both.\n        It was a policy failure because you have had Palestinians caged in Gaza\u00a0since 2007, without any hope, and in that long period of 16 years, you have conditions in the Gaza Strip (going) from bad to worse by the day; they blame, of course, Israel\u2019s blockade of Gaza, but there\u2019s also a fair share of the blame on Hamas, which failed to provide employment and other services.\n  Youth unemployment in Gaza is 60%, the\u00a0highest in the world. There is no hope whatsoever. So, Hamas wanted to do something to break this deadlock, even if it was very dramatic. If they freed their prisoners from Israel, they could at least bring in something not only for Gaza but also the Palestinians.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/opinions/palestinian-analyst-hamas-hroub-bergen/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

Unlike behemoth contemporaries\u00a0(notably\u00a0\u201cFriends\u201d), the show has survived the two decades since its finale with its reputation almost entirely unblemished.\n        Few sitcoms have ever won such resounding critical acclaim, and no comeback show ever has. That is, unless you count\u00a0\u201cFrasier\u201d\u00a0itself.\n        As dedicated fans know, the character\u00a0of\u00a0Frasier\u00a0Crane\u00a0originated in \u201cCheers,\u201d the classic\u00a01980s sitcom about regulars at the titular Boston dive bar. \u201cFrasier\u201d followed\u00a0him to\u00a01990s Seattle, where he moved\u00a0in with his father Martin, a retired cop played by the late John Mahoney, and\u00a0rekindled\u00a0his relationship\u00a0with his snooty brother Niles\u00a0(David Hyde Pierce), an also successful (but strictly off-air) psychiatrist.\n        \u201cFrasier\u201d\u00a02.0, which recently debuted on Paramount+,\u00a0sees Crane back in Boston after a dazzling TV career and a less-dazzling breakup. Once again,\u00a0he\u2019s\u00a0surrounded by an entirely new main cast, most notably\u00a0Frasier\u2019s\u00a0son Freddy (Jack Cutmore-Scott), who\u2019s now a fully-grown Harvard dropout-turned-firefighter.\u00a0Grammer slips back into the role like a beloved Armani suit,\u00a0and many of the ingredients for the old magic are there. Whether they\u2019ll coalesce this time around is another matter.\n        Much\u00a0of what made the original \u201cFrasier\u201d so comforting was its insularity. Frasier and Niles\u00a0ruminated\u00a0about the inexpert new server at Cafe Nervosa, bold additions to the menu at Chez Henri and Seattle\u2019s opera program, not\u00a0Bill\u00a0Clinton\u2019s second term or Britney Spears\u2019 rise to world domination.\n        It\u2019s a sleight of hand also favored by perennials like \u201cCheers,\u201d \u201cCommunity\u201d and \u201cModern Family,\u201d and in principle, it\u2019s a wise move. The less time spent in the real world, the more soothing the viewing experience \u2014 and the less jarring a rewatch five, 10 or 30 years on.\n        In the first few episodes at least, the reboot\u00a0heeds the same wisdom. We don\u2019t know who\u2019s president, we\u2019ve not heard about TikTok and there are no clunky references to current pop culture.\u00a0But Frasier 2.0 will only prove a true refuge from the 2023\u00a0news cycle if it can fill its apolitical bubble with emotional substance.\n        The original\u00a0\u201cFrasier\u201d swerved a meaty chunk of contemporary discourse, but made up for it with a simmering undercurrent of class politics.\n        The tension between Frasier and Niles and their blue-collar father was a necessary rebuff to what would otherwise have been a deafening cacophony of self-indulgence. Their frivolous lifestyles were an unflattering contrast to that of Martin\u2019s caretaker, working-class Mancunian Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), whose relentless daily grind was constantly interrupted by Frasier\u2019s entreaties to \u201cget the door.\u201d\n        The result was a joyous vacillating harmony: Niles\u2019 secret love for Daphne often saw him abandon his prissy inclinations, and Frasier usually (eventually) conceded his father\u2019s wisdom. Frasier\u2019s producer Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin) didn\u2019t hesitate to check anyone, but saved her choicest\u00a0lines\u00a0\u2014 \u201cWell excuse me for not being rich enough to shop at the international house of tight ass\u201d \u2014\u00a0for Niles and Frasier.\n        That balance is harder to pull off 30 years later with a group boasting far more\u00a0homogenous\u00a0socioeconomic\u00a0status. Freddy has taken Martin\u2019s place as the chalk to Frasier\u2019s cheese, but in order to reheat the dynamic, the new show has flattened his original quirks.\n        Freddy has morphed from the dorky natural heir to Frasier and his astringent ex-wife Lilith to an American everyman who wants to eat off a hockey table \u2014 and it\u2019s not entirely clear how that happened.\n        Freddy\u2019s roommate,\u00a0young\u00a0single mom Eve (Jess Salgueiro), might offer a dose of realism, were it not for the fact she\u2019s also a bartender-slash-actor and apparently surviving without too much trouble after the year 1995.\n        Niles and Daphne\u2019s son David (Anders Keith), is a direct sub-in for the most absurd iteration of his father, and was presumably inoculated at birth against the unpretentious influence of his mother. Frasier\u2019s new colleagues Alan (Nicholas Lyndhurst) and Olivia (Toks Olagundoye) are Harvard professors. A rare flaw of the original has been cured in that the lead cast is no longer entirely\u00a0White, but in other respects, it\u2019s arguably less diverse.\n        Frasier 2.0 is so eager to\u00a0establish\u00a0the lay of the land that it\u00a0paints\u00a0in far broader strokes. Alan, Frasier\u2019s old Oxford chum, continues the irritating tradition instated by Daphne\u2019s drunken brothers for boozy Brits, and we gather almost immediately that\u00a0Olivia is picking up Roz\u2019s mantle as \u201cthe horny one.\u201d\n        There\u2019s far less subtlety off the bat compared to the 1993 lineup, whose foibles and vulnerabilities were revealed with such wonderful restraint over the course of years.\n        In a way, it\u2019s understandable that the new show is hasty to\u00a0reveal\u00a0its hand. There\u2019s a ton more television around now than there was three decades ago, and if audiences don\u2019t latch on immediately, there\u2019s an almost endless array of alternatives available at a scroll. And for all its exposition, it is funny.\n        David\u2019s laminated allergy card \u2014 \u201cthe red ones are fatal\u201d \u2014 is vintage, and by the standards of TV in general, the script sings. But that was never the\u00a0bar\u00a0this revival\u00a0would be held to.\n        There\u2019s no doubt that audiences in 2023 are primed for a fresh dose of comfort TV.\u00a0Re-watching\u00a0\u201cFrasier\u201d proved a\u00a0popular resort\u00a0during the pandemic, and this year\u2019s\u00a0challenges\u00a0are scarcely more bearable. But while I\u2019m eager to give the new series a chance, I\u2019m not convinced it has the same scope to envelop us in its own sequestered world.\n        \u201cFrasier\u201d was a cocoon, but one so rich with nuance, intimacy and lyricism that you could happily dive into it without any of your mental faculties feeling underserved. It seems unlikely the reboot can attain the same depth. But then, almost no TV show ever has.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/opinions/frasier-revival-kelsey-grammer-comfort-tv-thomas/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

It\u2019s unclear if any of them have the necessary support to\u00a0replace interim House Speaker\u00a0Patrick McHenry.\n        Once again, this House of Representatives is making history: It was the first\u00a0to use\u00a0a motion to vacate the speakership in 100 years, and now it\u00a0has become\u00a0the first Congress\u00a0to need two speaker elections with multiple ballots.\n        With so much turmoil in Congress, I have been asked by my students and the general public nearly every day, what comes next?\n        As\u00a0before, I think that history may provide some guidance, especially the study of political parties in the United States. To that end, let me introduce two more concepts from the annals of American history:\u00a0political realignment\u00a0and\u00a0deadlocked conventions. Both are venerable terms among historians and political scientists, but how do they matter in 2023? More importantly, what can they tell us about what comes next in the House of Representatives?\n        The answer to that last question, in short, is more deadlock in the House and the possible collapse of the Republican Party as we know it.\n        First, let\u2019s consider the concept of\u00a0political realignment. Historically, political realignment has occurred when groups of voters change their affiliation to a new political party or candidate, especially around presidential and midterm elections.\n        Back in 1955, influential political scientist V.O. Key\u00a0posited\u00a0the idea of realigning reelections to explain how the Republican Party of his day had come to dominate most presidential elections from Abraham Lincoln\u2019s surprise victory in 1860 until Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s ascendancy in 1932.\n        But in fact, realignment had been occurring much earlier, dating back at least to the\u00a0deadlocked election\u00a0of 1800 between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, and continuing through the beginning of the modern Democratic Party in 1828 with the\u00a0triumphant election\u00a0of Andrew Jackson.\n        Yet the period between 1852 and 1860 is\u00a0crucial\u00a0here, for it saw the last time a major political party collapsed (the Whig Party in 1854) and the dissolution of another political party (the Democratic Party\u00a0in 1860).\n        Let\u2019s start with the Whigs, whose\u00a0epic collapse\u00a0is still the stuff of historical legend. Despite having won two presidential elections and counting such notables as Daniel Webster, Henry Clay and Lincoln among their ranks, by 1854 the Whigs had become hopelessly divided into Northern and Southern factions over the issue of slavery.\n        The tipping point came with the passage of the divisive\u00a0Kansas-Nebraska Act\u00a0that permitted slavery\u00a0in all western territories.\n        The result was electrifying. The anti-slavery Whigs\u00a0felt\u00a0that the party had not gone far enough to resist the expansion of slavery, and they eventually coalesced into the Republican Party.\n        Southern Whigs, for their part,\u00a0joined\u00a0an anti-immigrant party (the American Party) or switched to supporting the Democrats. Whig partisan William Henry Seward, who would go on to become Lincoln\u2019s\u00a0secretary of state, was\u00a0content\u00a0to let his party die: \u201cLet, then, the Whig party pass. It committed a grievous fault, and grievously hath it answered [for] it. Let it march out of the field, therefore, with all the honors.\u201d\n        The collapse of the Whig Party soon signaled more divisions to come. In 1860, the Democratic Party\u00a0deadlocked\u00a0in its national convention in Charleston, South Carolina.\n        Appealing to the \u201csovereign states of the Union,\u201d Alabama secessionist William L. Yancey\u00a0demanded\u00a0further protections for the institution of slavery. When the Democratic convention refused to accept these demands, the Southern delegates\u00a0walked\u00a0out.\n        An effort to reunite the party in Baltimore in June equally\u00a0failed\u00a0to find consensus producing two candidates: Stephen Douglas of Illinois and John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. The Democratic rupture\u00a0led\u00a0in large part to the election of Lincoln and\u00a0set\u00a0the stage for later Southern secession from the Union.\n        Following the collapse of the Whig Party in 1854 and the Democratic Party\u2019s splintering in\u00a01860, American political parties have nearly collapsed numerous times.\n        The Republican Party split in 1912 when Theodore Roosevelt led a \u201cBull Moose\u201d\u00a0insurgency\u00a0against Republican William Howard Taft; the result was the election of Democrat Woodrow Wilson.\n        The 1924 Democratic Party famously\u00a0went\u00a0through 103 ballots before agreeing on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis of West Virginia.\n        In 1968, the pro- and anti-war Vietnam War factions in the Democratic Party\u00a0ruptured\u00a0over the selection of Hubert H. Humphrey as its nominee, leading to the election of Republican Richard Nixon in the fall.\n        More recently, in the election of 2020, the dissident \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement certainly\u00a0sapped\u00a0support from the Republican Party.\n        Of course, party realignment is a tricky thing since we only come to\u00a0know\u00a0that it has happened in hindsight. While some of these disputes led to realignment, often they\u00a0only\u00a0signal a loss of power for the party in question in the next election.\n        How does today\u2019s House Republican\u00a0conference\u00a0fit these patterns of disfunction? For one, the\u00a0viciousness\u00a0of the arguments within the GOP conference and\u00a0the threats to members\u00a0reveal a party in disarray. What some have termed a \u201cRepublican civil war\u201d seems aptly put, and as with the last Civil War, the consequences for the two-party system could be equally lasting.\n        For another, this intraparty animosity may well mean that we are witnessing the GOP break up in real time. Like the Whigs parted ways over the issue of slavery, Republicans today seem divided among those who wish to govern and those who wish merely to make noise.\n        If the Republicans of today remain deadlocked, they will suffer a fate similar to that of Democrats in 1860. A failure to reach a majority consensus signals the doom of an American political party.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/opinions/republicans-party-splits-in-history-balcerski/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View\u00a0more opinion\u00a0at CNN.", "body": "      It\u2019s not the end of tipping \u2014 unfortunately.\n        Like most cities, Chicago has a much lower minimum wage for restaurant staff and other workers who receive tips \u2014 $9.48 per hour compared to $15.80 for other workers. Earlier this month, the city council voted to phase out the \u201csubminimum wage\u201d over the next five years.\n        The Wall Street Journal\u00a0described\u00a0this as Chicago\u00a0eliminating the\u00a0\u201ctips-as-wage system,\u201d which makes it sound like a ban on tipping.\u00a0Some,\u00a0like economist Steve Hanke, are framing this as a sad day for diners, based on the belief that the financial incentive of tips is the only way to manage and motivate service staff.\n        Nick Kokonas, co-founder of restaurant software company Tock, argues the same, but from a positive perspective.\n        \u201cSimply put, tips will be eliminated entirely and restaurants will eventually move to a service charge equivalent to the tips,\u201d\u00a0Kokonas wrote on Twitter\u00a0in advance of Chicago\u2019s vote, citing\u00a0some of the benefits\u00a0of this shift: equalized pay between cooks and servers, less discrimination, seasonal stability of wages.\n        All of this is misleading.\n        While I\u00a0wish this ordinance was a harbinger for the end of tipping in Chicago,\u00a0having watched this play out in my hometown of Toronto, Ontario,\u00a0where tipping still occurs at most restaurants, I think that the people predicting this are wrong.\n        Based on my experience and research, I expect Chicago will see a small handful of restaurateurs transitioning to\u00a0service fees instead of tips (and getting review-bombed by people who think the money is going to the owners).\u00a0But\u00a0the majority of restaurants will leave tipping in place over fear that the sticker shock from folding the true labor cost into the menu prices will scare off customers, and that their best servers will leave them for venues where they can make the most money.\n        Indeed, if tips are\u00a0what most people claim \u2014\u00a0a voluntary gift for good service, on top of an employee\u2019s livable wage\u00a0\u2014 this law won\u2019t change\u00a0that. What\u2019s more, the restaurant business is based on an emotional relationship with diners, who for the past century have gotten used to this system, and it\u2019s very hard to\u00a0change\u00a0it.\n        It\u2019s a shame, because tipping has\u00a0always been a scam that enables restaurants to suppress labor costs, which keeps menu prices down. This sustains the illusion of an affordable dining experience because the customer is expected to pay for the labor of service staff instead of the\u00a0employer.\n        But tips are really just a replacement\u00a0for a livable wage. If restaurants had to pay a living wage to their front-of-house staff instead of expecting diners to pay employees \u201cvoluntarily,\u201d their labor costs would rise, and prices with them.\n        Letting customers determine the earnings of a business\u2019 staff, thereby subjecting them to the whims and abuses of guests, was always an odious way to employ people.\u00a0Tipping emerged as a model for employing formerly enslaved Black workers\u00a0without having to pay them a real wage, if anything at all.\n        It can lead to\u00a0economic racial discrimination\u00a0and\u00a0suppression of wages for cooks.\u00a0It\u2019s a horrible system that most companies in North America wouldn\u2019t accept.\n        Instead, restaurants should pay a living wage (if the revenue does not cover the actual cost of labor, what kind of business is it?), raise menu prices to reflect the true cost, and engage with diners about the value of treating employees like professionals, rather than plan for them to depend on the personal charity of diners.\n        I recently went\u00a0to a hospitality conference to moderate a panel about tipping. Every owner or manager I spoke with described attracting, hiring and retaining good staff as their number one challenge.\n        In my research on innovative models in hospitality, the operators I engage with, the ones challenging industry orthodoxy in a variety of ways, are holding on to their best people. Many have done this by eliminating tips, as the non-tipping restaurants usually offer better wages and benefits. They also offer more consistent hours, an investment in employees\u2019 professional growth, and most importantly a workplace where cooks and servers are not pitted against each other due to their pay disparity.\n        These businesses have effectively strategized to attract and retain quality employees. Those workers stick around because they are service professionals who want to grow their jobs into careers while being treated with respect.\n        There are some owners who still hold on to the idea that cooks work for love of food, while servers are mercenaries, motivated only by money. Despite today\u2019s dire labor shortage, precious few restaurants seem willing to re-examine their employment model in order to address it.\n        The problem I encounter, when speaking with operators candidly, is that diners have little understanding of how tips work. I still encounter people who insist it\u2019s an acronym for\u00a0\u201cto insure prompt service.\u201d\n        There\u2019s a type of diner who enjoys the power that tipping grants them over workers, who belittles service staff and expects tipped employees to flirt with them. They are a minority. But if restaurants won\u2019t evolve because their business is catering to the worst kind of customer, they are less practitioners of providing memorable culinary experiences than they are trapped in an abusive relationship.\n        I hope that this is a real moment of truth for the hospitality leaders of\u00a0Chicago \u2014 and for other cities around the country.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/opinions/chicago-restaurant-tipping-mintz/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

View\u00a0more opinion\u00a0at CNN.", "body": "      Egypt has re-emerged as a pivotal actor in the Middle East thanks to the Israel-Gaza War. Its\u00a0revived influence\u00a0was epitomized by the\u00a0summit Cairo convened on Saturday for a number of Arab and European leaders. Although it didn\u2019t produce a unified statement from the parties, underscoring the challenges of finding common\u00a0ground, it was the crucial player in drawing top leaders together after several Arab countries refused to meet with President Joe Biden earlier in the week.\n        Egypt\u2019s importance is not just as a leader among Western-allied Arab countries, however. The country is a critical\u00a0partner\u00a0for the Biden administration on all issues related to Gaza because its control of the\u00a0Rafah crossing\u00a0\u2014 currently the only point of entry into the embattled Gaza Strip since Israel closed all crossings on its borders after Hamas\u2019 October 7 terror attack \u2014 allows Egypt to dictate and leverage the terms by which humanitarian assistance can enter the Palestinian territory.\n        It\u2019s understandable if Washington, which provides Egypt with over\u00a0$1 billion per year\u00a0in military assistance, is frustrated that Cairo isn\u2019t\u00a0allowing\u00a0American citizens and other nationals to exit Gaza\u00a0via the crossing, as Egypt has seemingly made their\u00a0departure\u00a0contingent on the entry of aid. It\u2019s also understandable if humanitarian groups are frustrated that Egypt won\u2019t open its border for a humanitarian corridor to let out hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Gazans who are trying to take refuge in the south of the Gaza Strip, which Rafah sits on, as the most intense fighting rages in the north.\n        But Egypt\u2019s positions reflect serious, and legitimate, concerns. First and foremost is the fear of a massive refugee flow if the crossing were opened. A decade after the Syrian civil war started, Egypt\u00a0claims\u00a0to host 9 million refugees from different countries, with no horizon of repatriation for most in sight. For Egypt, a deluge of Palestinian refugees would not only pose humanitarian and economic challenges \u2014 Egypt is currently experiencing a devastating\u00a0economic crisis\u00a0\u2014 but also security and\u00a0political ones.\n        Egyptian\u00a0President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, in uncharacteristically explicit remarks, on Wednesday warned that transferring Palestinians into Sinai will turn the peninsula into a launching pad for attacks against Israel, eliciting Israeli reprisals, triggering war between the two countries and upending the longest peace between Israel and any Arab country.\n        Additionally, the movement of Palestinian refugees out of Gaza would evoke memories of the mass displacement that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948. Egypt fears that such an eventuality would bring an end to any future prospect of Palestinian-Israeli peace based on a two-state solution, instead bringing a diplomatic void, and inflaming Arab public opinion.\n        This concern is so widely and deeply held in the region that, even as Palestinian civilian casualties mounted after October 7, other Arab countries supported Egypt in its vehement opposition to opening the Sinai for refugees. Indeed, after concluding a tour to several Arab capitals,\u00a0Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u00a0told Al-Arabiya TV that he heard \u201cfrom virtually every \u2026 leader that I\u2019ve talked to in the region that that idea is a nonstarter, and so we do not support it.\u201d\n        Additionally, Egypt has privately held that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is ultimately\u00a0Israel\u2019s problem, and that the latter should bear any\u00a0political or territorial costs\u00a0of its resolution. During the Trump administration, an American proposal to build infrastructure in Sinai to serve Gaza was roundly rejected by Cairo, part of Egyptian fears that a slippery slope that could draw it into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n        Egypt is also concerned that open crossing could allow in Hamas and its sympathizers. Hamas is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sisi\u2019s most serious domestic political rival. And\u00a0Egypt has faced Islamist terror in the Sinai Peninsula since the 2011 revolution that toppled the Mubarak regime.\n        For all these reasons, shortly after Hamas took over Gaza in 2007,\u00a0Egypt sealed the border. By 2018, according to Human Rights Watch, Egypt had razed the entire Sinai city of Rafah on the Egyptian side of the borders, destroying thousands of homes and displacing\u00a070,000 persons, to create a\u00a0nearly mile-wide buffer zone\u00a0to prevent the movement of weapons and terrorists in tunnels between Egypt and Gaza. To emphasize the point, Egypt even\u00a0flooded those tunnels. Two years later, in 2020, Egypt built a 20-foot\u00a0reinforced concrete wallthat reaches 16 feet below ground.\n        This wall has helped ensure the war in Gaza doesn\u2019t spill over into Egypt. Like other Middle Eastern states, however, what is happening in Gaza is having an impact within Egypt, where there is a significant reservoir of support for the Palestinians. For the first time since the Mubarak days, the Egyptian government\u00a0has organized anti-Israel protests\u00a0to\u00a0try to\u00a0come out ahead of public opinion on supporting the Palestinians and better control the demonstrations.\n        The very staunch US support for Israel, which reflects longstanding\u00a0American\u00a0policy, sharpened further by the brutal nature of Hamas terror and Biden\u2019s own convictions about it, has inevitably created additional tensions in the Arab world. The view that the US is complicit in the human suffering in Gaza is widely\u00a0held\u00a0in the Arab world,\u00a0partly\u00a0out of compassion and\u00a0partly out of\u00a0political opportunism. This, naturally, complicates Egypt\u2019s engagement with the US and helps explain why the meeting with Biden last week was canceled, after (later disproven) reports of Israeli targeting a hospital in Gaza circulated.\n        However, the delicate way the US approached the cancellation, framing it as a response to the\u00a0period of mourning announced\u00a0by the three Arab countries and expressing sympathy for the victims, helped ease pressure on Sisi, who would have been criticized by his public for appearing with the US president at such highly charged times, and was no doubt appreciated in Cairo. Subsequent US policy, focusing on\u00a0delivery of aid into Gaza\u00a0also signaled support for Egypt\u2019s position, buying some goodwill from Cairo.\n        Still, if Washington is committed to the objectives of both supporting Israel in its campaign to degrade, if not eradicate, Hamas and at the same time providing critical humanitarian support to Palestinian civilians, the US will need to coordinate with its Arab allies. For reasons of geography, history and diplomatic heft, Egypt is the linchpin.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/opinions/opinion-egypt-israel-gaza-hamas-afraid-omari-schenker/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

The book ranks in the top ten on\u00a0Amazon\u2019s classic literature best seller list, and last year Russian media reported that it was the\u00a0most downloaded e-book\u00a0in that country.\n        Earlier this month, Elon Musk posted a picture on X (formerly Twitter) showing off his new T-shirt emblazoned with\u00a0\u201cWhat Would Orwell Think\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0an ironic homage from a man many see as enabling a resurgence of Orwellian disinformation on the social media platform.\n        \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four,\u201d\u00a0a searing denunciation of totalitarianism,\u00a0censorship and disinformation, brought us the terms \u201cdoublethink\u201d and \u201cThought Police.\u201d Its relevance in the era of Trump, Putin and Xi has led many to return to the novel or to seek it out for the first time.\n        The\u00a0dangerous disinformation campaigns\u00a0attending the outbreak of the war between Israel and Hamas earlier this month have only underscored the relevance of Orwell\u2019s critique of those\u00a0who\u00a0seek to rewrite history for their own ends.\n        Yet, while\u00a0\u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d\u00a0is revered for its clear-eyed depiction of tyranny, there have long been\u00a0those who chafed under the book\u2019s representation of gender.\n        Now, nearly 75 years since its publication, the novelist Sandra Newman has\u00a0produced a feminist retelling of\u00a0\u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d which asks us to imagine how the story might have looked had it been told from the woman\u2019s perspective.\n        \u201cJulia\u201d\u00a0forms part of a long tradition of fictional retellings that\u00a0complicate the perspective of an original work\u2019s protagonist by telling the story through the eyes of a marginalized character.\n        Milton\u2019s 17th-century epic\u00a0poem \u201cParadise Lost,\u201d which narrates the Old Testament from Satan\u2019s perspective, is the first and arguably the best example of\u00a0this\u00a0genre,\u00a0which also includes\u00a0novels such as Jean Rhys\u2019 1966\u00a0\u201cWide Sargasso Sea,\u201d a retelling of Charlotte Bronte\u2019s\u00a0\u201cJane Eyre\u201d\u00a0from the perspective of Bertha, the \u201cmadwoman in the attic,\u201d\u00a0and\u00a0John Gardner\u2019s\u00a0\u201cGrendel.\u201d\u00a0There have also been\u00a0film and television reinterpretations\u00a0such as\u00a0Disney\u2019s latest Star Wars spinoff\u00a0\u201cAshoka,\u201d which offers a new female-centered perspective on the fate of the Jedi after the fall of the Empire.\u00a0As with Newman\u2019s\u00a0\u201cJulia,\u201d the most successful retellings are both homage to and critique of the original work.\n        In \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four,\u201d agents of the totalitarian regime\u2019s Thought Police entrap, arrest, torture and finally mentally break a couple perceived to be dangerously disloyal to Big Brother\u2019s regime. In Big Brother\u2019s eyes, both are threats worth eliminating, but in Orwell\u2019s estimation, they are not equal.\n        The male member of the couple is the hero of the novel. We know his full name. Winston Smith. We know that he is thirty nine years old, and a factotum in the Records department of the Ministry of Truth (where he spends his days manufacturing fake news), that he has brown eyes, bad teeth and varicose veins.\u00a0The woman presumably also has a full name, but we never learn it. She is simply Julia.\n        In fact, according to Orwell, she is not a woman but a\u00a0\u201cgirl,\u201d whom Winston estimates to be in her late 20s. (Tellingly, the reader never learns her age, only Winston\u2019s perception of it.) Her principal traits are her physicality and her voracious sexuality.\n        They both work in the Ministry of Truth, but while Winston uses his mind to rewrite history, Julia uses her hands in \u201csome mechanical job.\u201d She is uninterested in politics.\u00a0 She falls asleep when Winston attempts to share with her his revelations about the inner workings of Big Brother\u2019s regime and laughs with delight when he dismissively claims that she is \u201conly a rebel from the waist downwards.\u201d\n        While they are both caught up in the Thought Police\u2019s net, it\u2019s clear that Winston is the big fish. Julia only meets O\u2019Brien, their captor and interrogator, because Winston invites her to tag along when he pays a visit to the great man\u2019s apartment.\n        At first reading, Orwell\u2019s marginalization of Julia might seem like simply a product of its time\u00a0\u2014\u00a0yet a growing body of work, including most recently\u00a0Anna Funder\u2019s\u00a0\u201cWifedom: Mrs. Orwell\u2019s Invisible Life,\u201d\u00a0has emerged suggesting that Orwell was exceptionally misogynistic and patriarchal even by the standards of the 1940s.\n        Orwell first came under attack from second-wave feminists in the 1980s, including\u00a0Daphne Patai\u00a0and\u00a0Beatrix Campbell, who argued that his work generally ignored the position of women within society and specifically obscured the\u00a0burdens that poverty places on working-class women.\n  A spate of archival revelations\u00a0over the past few years further reinforced existing evidence that he was a philanderer who frequented prostitutes and seemingly never missed an opportunity to proposition both his wife\u2019s friends and his friends\u2019 wives.\n        So, how would the story\u00a0of \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d\u00a0have looked different had it been told by a feminist?\n        For one thing, Julia would have had a last name. Julia Worthing. She would also have a fully developed backstory.\u00a0 In Newman\u2019s novel, Julia comes from a family of bourgeois socialists who are initially in the vanguard of Big Brother\u2019s revolution.\n        Her family is first exiled and ultimately murdered when the leader, like the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin on whom he was modeled, consolidates his hold on power by eliminating his potential rivals within the party.\n        Julia\u2019s sexuality and her anti-intellectual practical-mindedness are the tools that help her survive life as an exile and an orphan. \u00a0She sleeps her way back from exile and into a good party job in London.\n        She mentally compartmentalizes the crimes that she is forced to commit to survive, and she possesses a knack for black-marketeering, which keeps her in chocolates, coffee and cigarettes.\u00a0Whereas Winston\u2019s rebellion is driven by an intellectual rejection of Big Brother, hers is ultimately propelled by love. (Crucially, not love for Winston Smith who is, at best, a minor character in Julia\u2019s story).\n        It\u2019s an ingenious conceit. At several points, I found myself asking whether this portrait of Julia could really be squared with the two-dimensional picture of her that we get in\u00a0\u201cNineteen Eighty-Four,\u201d and whether the story that Newman tells could hold simultaneously\u00a0with Orwell\u2019s narrative.\u00a0That they arguably could underscores how differently the world can look depending on your perspective.\n        Newman\u2019s attempt to turn Orwell\u2019s Oceania on its head and look at it from the perspective of a woman never granted the dignity of a last name is in many ways not dissimilar to this summer\u2019s blockbuster attempt to reclaim \u201cBarbie\u201d for feminism.\n        Like Barbie Handler, Julia Worthing is a product of the patriarchy who refuses to stay in the box and let herself be objectified and diminished. She insists on being the heroine of her own story and, in doing so, pushes Winston Smith into a life of blond fragility.\n        But if the Barbie movie largely dodged the problematic question of Barbie\u2019s hypersexualized physical appearance in favor of a focus on her intellectual awakening, Newman\u2019s Julia remains fundamentally a rebel from the waist downwards.\n        Why doesn\u2019t Julia get to be an intellectual rebel in her own right? Why must she be characterized by the traditional \u201cfeminine\u201d traits of empathy, practicality and intuition, not to mention a stereotypical physical attractiveness?\n        The women\u2019s movement has long been divided between maternalist or biological feminists who view woman as fundamentally different from men and seek to elevate and celebrate that difference, and equal rights feminists who argue that gender differences are largely societal constructs and that, but for patriarchy, empathy would not be deemed a feminine trait nor intellect a masculine one. (Others, of course, would argue that the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes.)\n        In doubling down on Orwell\u2019s depiction of Julia as a practical-minded anti-intellectual, Newman\u2019s book appears to come down firmly in the former camp.\n        One of my favorite parts of the original\u00a0\u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d\u00a0is a rare instance in which Orwell grants Julia intelligence and agency, with the narrator even conceding that, \u201cIn some ways she was far more acute than Winston.\u201d\n        This moment comes as the couple are discussing the seemingly endless war between Oceania and its rivals, when \u201cshe startle[s] him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, \u2018just to keep people frightened\u2019. This was an idea that had literally never occurred to him.\u201d\n        Perhaps this is just evidence of Julia\u2019s feminine intuition, but it at least hints that she possesses a power of reasoning equal to if not beyond Winston\u2019s.\n        In exalting Julia\u2019s feminine practicality above Winston\u2019s idealism, Newman is arguably adhering to Orwell\u2019s original pessimistic message\u00a0about the futility of clinging to notions of intellectual freedom under absolute tyranny. But it is cold comfort to imagine that Julia might have survived by forfeiting her right to think for herself.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/opinions/george-orwell-1984-sandra-newman-julia-beers/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

General David Petraeus, one of the most prominent practitioners of warfare, and Lord Andrew Roberts, an eminent historian of war, have written a new book, \u201cConflict: The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine.\u201d\n        It\u2019s an insightful and thorough examination of key military conflicts over the past seven and a half decades.\u00a0The book was published as the conflict between Hamas and Israel entered its second week.\n        Petraeus and Roberts provided a sobering assessment of the challenge facing the Israeli military in trying to eliminate Hamas after its October 7 terrorist attack on southern Israel killed more than 1,400 people.\n        They emphasized that policymakers who do not have a good plan for the \u201cday after\u201d the fighting stops are simply seeding the ground for the next conflict, which in the case of Gaza necessitates some kind of positive vision for what the Palestinians can expect when the guns fall silent.\n        I interviewed\u00a0\u00a0Petraeus and Roberts for the Audible podcast\u00a0\u201cIn the Room With Peter Bergen.\u201d\u00a0 Our discussion was edited for length and clarity.\n  PETER BERGEN:\u00a0 How might this war unfold?\n  DAVID PETRAEUS:\u00a0Israel\u2019s big idea right now is to destroy Hamas, which means rendering the enemy incapable of accomplishing its mission without reconstitution. As a military commander, that means not just a lot of as-precise-as-possible airstrikes, but at some point, you have to go in on the ground, clear every building, every floor, every room, every basement, every tunnel \u2014 part of a very extensive tunnel system \u2014 against terrorists who know this place better than the backs of their hands, have demonstrated significant tactical creativity, and have\u00a0shown a willingness to blow themselves up to take Israeli soldiers with them.\n        And by the way, you not only have to clear every building like that, but you also must then retain each building by leaving a substantial force behind, one that\u2019s large enough that it can\u2019t be swarmed by the enemy who can then add captured soldiers as hostages to the over 200 hostages that have already been taken. And, of course, this will all be done in a densely populated area with substantial numbers of civilians\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even with hundreds of thousands of people\u00a0\u2014\u00a0leaving Gaza City and northern Gaza.\n        Andrew and I have gone back through all these conflicts that we recount from 1945 until now, and we can\u2019t envision a more challenging context for a military commander and soldiers than this one.\n        The big idea in the past was described as \u201cmowing the grass.\u201d\u00a0Hamas would do something particularly egregious. Israel would make a limited incursion \u2014 use a lot of air power, drone strikes and so forth to \u201cmow the grass\u201d to damage Hamas, its organization, and its infrastructure. And then Israelis would enjoy a few years of relative peace.\n        Clearly, that approach has been invalidated. But if you go in and say you mow the grass all the way down to the dirt \u2014 you can even pull the grass out \u2014 if you don\u2019t have an answer to the question of \u201cthen what\u201d that is reasonable and that can keep Hamas and Islamic Jihad from coming back, you\u2019ll have mowed the grass, and perhaps it doesn\u2019t grow back for a few years but eventually, it will, and the Israelis are going to be back in the situation that they were in before that horrific attack two weeks ago.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Some of the other obstacles that the Israelis will likely encounter in Gaza: Hostages, human shields, suicide bombers, improvised explosive devices, booby traps, snipers and fighters not in uniform. And Hamas has had years to prepare.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Also, a lot of civilians, in addition to hostages. It\u2019s hard to imagine anything more challenging than this, and that\u2019s especially true if there is a push to do this rapidly.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 The fight against ISIS in Mosul that began in late 2016, the second largest city in Iraq, seems like an interesting analogue to what may unfold in Gaza: Mosul was a city of two million people that ISIS took over and had plenty of time to dig in, its foot soldiers were willing to fight to the death.\n        How long did it take the Iraqi military assisted by American advisers and US airpower to remove ISIS from Mosul?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Over nine months. Longer if you just take the period of planning, the positioning of forces, and the setting of conditions for the attack, and that was with considerable American support \u2014 what we call \u201cadvise, assist, and enable,\u201d the enabling including lots of drones and precision munitions. And also,\u00a0a lot of situational awareness from American intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance platforms that we could put over the fighting.\n        We had an American officer in Iraqi command posts with Iraqi commanders, literally watching the same screen, watching our drone \u201cfeed,\u201d so that they could make decisions together. They could call on American air power, precision surface-to-surface munitions, and so forth.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 It still took nine months.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Exactly right. And by the way, Mosul\u2019s population wasn\u2019t two million at that time. Hundreds of thousands of civilians had left. It was certainly roughly the same size of Gaza, but not with the same number of high-rises that you find in Gaza.\u00a0.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Two of the Israeli goals seem incompatible \u2014 destroy Hamas completely and try and rescue the 200-plus hostages.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0\u00a0 It will be very challenging to accomplish both those objectives.\u00a0 And then beyond that,\u00a0how to administer Gaza after the conflict is over?\u00a0Not just handing out humanitarian assistance and rebuilding and reestablishing markets and schools and so forth, but also\u00a0conducting a\u00a0counterinsurgency campaign to ensure that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad can\u2019t come back. And of course,\u00a0a vision for the Palestinian people of what life can be like when Hamas is dismantled has to be part\u00a0of this effort as well.\n  A Regional Conflict?\u00a0ANDREW ROBERTS:\u00a0 It\u2019s also worth pointing out, of course, that you\u2019ve got to do all of this in a situation where you don\u2019t know what Iran will do next. You don\u2019t know what Hezbollah in southern Lebanon is going to do next.\u00a0The West Bank front could open up at any moment. A large number of Israeli reservists, 360,000, has been called up but if you\u2019re suddenly fighting on multiple fronts, that force gets dissipated.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 General Petraeus, you were CENTCOM commander. Your area of operation included all the countries around Israel with some kind of alignment with Iran, the Houthis in Yemen who are backed by Iran, Iranian-backed militias have a presence in Iraq, Syria is strongly backed by Iran, Hezbollah is effectively an arm of the Iranian government in Lebanon and Hamas itself has Iranian support. So, when you look at all that, what do you think?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 I think it is enormously challenging, and it could get worse. There could be regionalization of the war in a way that would be very, very serious.\u00a0You can assess that Hezbollah doesn\u2019t want to revisit the war it fought with Israel in 2006 and the damage and destruction inflicted on Hezbollah in the wake of their incursion into Israel. But Iran may push them that way, and so could public sentiment in the Shia areas in the south of Lebanon.\n  Hezbollah has 150,000 rockets, so they are not a little militia force.\u00a0That number of rockets could overwhelm Israel\u2019s air defense system.\u00a0But then, Israel would be compelled to respond with devastating strikes.\u00a0And Hezbollah knows that.\u00a0Hopefully, that knowledge will dissuade them from conducting substantial attacks on Israel.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0If this invasion happens, the pictures of destruction will just go on and on and on. The images are going to inflame the Arab world.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0The amount of battlefield imagery is a much more prominent element in conflict now than it was even 10, 15 years ago when I was privileged to command in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u00a0This is, of course, because of the widespread present proliferation of social media sites, some of which are really siloes for one view or another, the proliferation of smart phones, access to the internet, and social media\u00a0onto which individuals can upload videos, but that are not always obviously reporting truthfully.\u00a0It is also because of the greater presence of commercial imagery and other forms of open-source intelligence.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Would pressure on Hezbollah to mount a large-scale attack increase as weeks go on and more pictures of destruction come out of Gaza?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 It certainly could. So, the periods after Friday prayers will become more challenging in Muslim countries in the region, and also in Israel. This was often a challenge in Iraq when I was in command there: If there was some issue that arose that aroused the people, then tragically, it would often be amplified by the mullahs of different mosques in their Friday sermons and the resulting demonstrations could be very problematic.\n  Surprise attacksBERGEN:\u00a0 There are a couple of big themes in your book that I want to draw out. Robert Gates, the former US Secretary of Defense, kept a maxim in his office which said, \u201cThe easiest way to achieve complete strategic surprise is to commit an act that makes no sense or is even self-destructive.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Yet\u00a0you say, \u201csurprise attacks are surprisingly common.\u201d I found it fascinating that you found that dictatorships and terrorist groups are much more likely to launch surprise attacks because democracies must build consensus, which can take time. They can\u2019t just launch a war without the political support of their people.\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0It tends to be authoritarian or totalitarian powers that launch these surprise attacks. What we discovered, again and again, is that \u2014 and which I think, by the way, will also be the case here with the Gazan situation \u2014 is the response of the country that\u2019s been attacked is all the more outraged for having been the victim of a surprise attack. Look at America after Pearl Harbor. There was a sort of righteous fury that grabbed the nation and held it for four years until the US defeated Japan.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Same after 9/11, of course. Now, interestingly, President Joe Biden, in addition to expressing America\u2019s big idea, which is to have Israel\u2019s back absolutely, also offered a caution to the Israelis about what followed 9/11, acknowledging that we didn\u2019t get everything right, that the quest for vengeance can lead you to take actions that, in some respects, you might look back and say we\u2019d like to have a redo of this or that.\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 Well, partly, I think that\u2019s because, especially in response to surprise attacks, it\u2019s very difficult to promote a compromise solution if you\u2019ve just been attacked, let alone attacked in this medieval and sadistic way that Hamas has attacked in southern Israel. So, to get into the sort of frame of mind where you are offering something to the enemy requires an extraordinary degree of statesmanship that is often not present when you\u2019re the victim of a surprise attack.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0The 1973 Yom Kippur War, you cover in some detail in the book. What are the parallels with this war that Hamas has unleashed?\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 The Yom Kippur War started with an Arab surprise attack and ended with a catastrophe for the Arab armies, so hopefully, there are some direct parallels with history in this latest Hamas attack. The Israeli army was within sight of Damascus and was only a few days away from Cairo when peace broke out in 1973.\u00a0 So, there is a tremendous capacity in the IDF for taking the punches and returning them with vigor, which I\u2019m assuming will be the case when it comes to Hamas.\n  Securing GazaBERGEN:\u00a0 In 2005, the Israelis pulled out of Gaza, and elections were held which Hamas then won, and there have been no elections since. Israel doesn\u2019t seem to want to own the Gaza problem.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 They do not want to, and also they can\u2019t bring in the Palestinian Authority (the overarching Palestinian\u00a0entity based in Israel\u2019s West Bank) on the backs of Israeli tanks.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0\u00a0 In your book, you say that to secure any kind of area, as a rule of thumb, you need one security person per 50 inhabitants. There are some two million inhabitants of Gaza, which would suggest you need around 40,000 security personnel to secure Gaza. And if the Israelis aren\u2019t going to secure it, who is?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0You\u2019ve raised a very good point; whatever interim international authority might be established in Gaza will not just have to distribute humanitarian assistance, restore basic services, repair damaged infrastructure, reopen markets, schools, clinics and hospitals, and restore all the social services that Hamas\u2019 political wing have overseen. The interim authority is also going to have to conduct a counterinsurgency operation with a hard edge, with very good intelligence capabilities, because there will be remnants of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, and they will try to reestablish control in Gaza. That has to be prevented.\n        I don\u2019t know that 40,000 security personnel will be necessary in this particular case, but certainly, it will be a substantial force \u2013 and I would err on the side of larger rather than smaller.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Another one of the big themes that I took away from the book is, again and again, policymakers often have no real plan for the \u201cday after\u201d the fighting stops.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 There was an episode when I was a two-star general and commander of the great 101st Airborne Division in the early days of the fight to Baghdad, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, where we were ordered to take the city of Najaf, a city of about 400,000-500,000 people then,\u00a0and the holiest city in Shia Islam.\n        After several days of fighting, the enemy collapsed and melted away.\u00a0 We took control of the city, and I go\u00a0on the radio. I called my boss and\u00a0 said, \u201cHey, boss, I\u2019ve got good news and bad news. The good news is that we own Najaf.\u201d\n        He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the bad news?\u201d\n        I replied, \u201cWe own Najaf. What do you want us to do with it?\u201d\n        And so, I hope that some weeks, months down the road, there\u2019s not a call that\u2019s made, \u201cHey, boss, I got good news and bad news. We own Gaza City or all of Gaza. What do you want us to do with it?\u201d\n        There\u00a0has\u00a0to be a viable plan for the day after.\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 The Malayan Emergency of 1952 to \u201960 is a very good example of where the big idea was got right, not just \u201cclear and hold,\u201d but also the fact that the commander there, Sir Gerald Templer, offered the Malaysian people their independence pretty much from the beginning as they fought a communist insurgency.\n        And so that helped capture their \u201chearts and minds.\u201d That was where the original phrase came from; winning the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of the local population was essential in putting down the local communist insurgency. So, they got the population on side, which was essential, defeated the communists and independence was given in 1957.\n        I don\u2019t know how that would translate into the present Gazan situation, but there has to be something that the people on the ground can really look forward to, something positive.\n  A positive vison for the Palestinians\u00a0PETRAEUS:\u00a0There has to be a positive vision for the Palestinian people that life will be much better if Hamas is eliminated and out of their lives and that the international community will support them.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0But the Israeli government has little to no credibility with the Palestinians in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority doesn\u2019t have much credibility either because they\u2019re in the West Bank, and they\u2019re seen as almost collaborators with Israel by the folks in Gaza.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 And by the folks in the West Bank, in many cases, too.\n        It couldn\u2019t be more difficult. Andrew uses the phrase \u201cfiendishly difficult,\u201d and that is correct.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0So, if you were advising Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today from a military point of view, general, what would you advise, and Andrew, from a political point of view, what would you advise?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Well, what\u2019s interesting is I think you must combine the two. You can\u2019t just say that you\u2019re going to destroy Hamas. You also must lay out the vision for the Palestinian people and the future of Gaza.\u00a0 And this will be challenging because there will be a vision announced, I hope, but there\u2019s also going to be a substantial loss of innocent civilian life and very substantial damage and destruction of civilian infrastructure and civilian dwellings.\n  Israel\u2019s advantagesROBERTS:\u00a0 The last chapter of our book is \u201cThe Future of War,\u201d and we look at cyber and sensors and space, AI, robotics, and also, of course, drones. And this is one area where the Israelis will have an advantage.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Well, let\u2019s talk about some Israeli potential advantages. You mentioned robots. Also infrared and acoustic tools that might be able to look down into tunnels and armored bulldozers. What about morale? Morale is a major theme of your book. Whether it\u2019s the Ukrainians fighting the Russians or Israelis volunteering to fight today. It\u2019s a nebulous concept on some levels, but how important is it?\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 Morale is absolutely central to warfare. We came across this again and again in the course of writing this book. It\u2019s a very interesting thing when demoralization can take place and how it can take place. But if you\u2019ve got morale, it is \u201cworth several divisions,\u201d as Napoleon always used to say.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 You\u2019ve had a barbaric, horrific, unspeakable set of actions that killed some 1,400 Israelis, and to put that in perspective, from a US point of view, that\u2019s the equivalent of more than 50,000 Americans having been killed on 9/11, as opposed to the 3,000 terrible losses that we sustained. And the over 200 hostages are the equivalent of well over 6,000 Americans being taken hostage on that day. And I think we are not fully appreciating the impact of all this on the Israeli people and government.\n        The Israelis have enormous morale. When they were called up,\u00a0members of the reserves literally drove their own vehicles down to southern Israel.\u00a0And they just\u00a0parked their cars on the side of the road and\u00a0reported for duty.\n        But that also does raise yet one more challenge. The bulk of this force is reservists. They\u2019re not serving professionals or on active duty. Some will have done recent active duty or perhaps a lot of reserve duty but by no means all, and I\u2019m sure that there are those in the ranks who are a bit more advanced in age than the typical 19-year-old infantry soldier.\n        So, they\u2019ve got to be brought back in, reequipped, introduced to the more cutting-edge technology, say, night vision goggles and close combat optics on weapons that are very, very important so that you can have a precise fire, not just \u201cspray and pray.\u201d\u00a0 So, all of this has to be done as well. You have to reorganize, re-equip and retrain to some degree. At the very least, they\u2019ve got to get whatever weapon systems they have now and get reacquainted with that and do drills with their fellow soldiers as units.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 And, of course, reservists are people who\u2019ve got day jobs in the Israeli economy. If this continues for a long time, you have social, political, and economic effects inside Israel.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0In this case, there are multiple clocks running, but one of those is the domestic economy clock, that if you call up 360,000 out of a population that\u2019s around 10 million, obviously there\u2019s an enormous impact on the economy.\n        Beyond that, the policy makers have\u00a0essentially taken the slack out of the trigger, and there will be pressure to squeeze, perhaps sooner rather than later, because of the imperative of getting on with this.\u00a0 But that should be tempered with a recognition that urban operations need to be pursued in a deliberate, methodical, careful manner.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0General Petraeus you famously said close to the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003, \u201cTell me how this ends.\u201d How does this Gaza war end?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0It depends on the conduct of the campaign. Can they fully clear, hold and then start the rebuilding?\u00a0 Are they able to identify, in particular, a true vision for the Palestinian people that is inspiring to them?\u00a0 \u201cInspiring\u201d might be a bit of a high bar, but let\u2019s use this moment as a catalyst \u2014 this horrible, despicable, unspeakable set of barbaric murders \u2014 to try to communicate a vision for the future that can\u00a0reduce\u00a0 grievances in the future, noting that nothing can conceivably justify the atrocities committed by Hamas.\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 One thing that we can be certain of, though, in all this uncertainty is that if Israel doesn\u2019t destroy Hamas, or if it fails to, then we know how this ends, because it ends with an organization which, in the next generation, will do exactly the same thing to Israelis, will continue to kill Jews.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 General Petraeus, you\u2019re a former director of the CIA. After October 7th, we\u2019ve heard a lot about intelligence failures. The question is, when we get further away from this, do you suspect that it will be seen as mostly a policy failure, misunderstanding Hamas\u2019\u00a0aims, having kind of a too-rosy view of Hamas and so ignoring intelligence that might have been germane?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 I think this was a real intelligence failure, and I think it was also a military readiness failure. My speculation is that Hamas dramatically improved its operational security and prevented Israel from developing the understanding of the extremists\u2019 intentions well before they materialized as terrorist operations.\n        I think we\u2019ll come to understand better how creative Hamas was in using all kinds of ways to get into Israel \u2014 paragliders as well as bulldozers and golf carts. But in advance of that, they blinded the surveillance systems along the wall by taking out the communication nodes that connect those observation systems to command posts that are monitoring those systems, and so there was an overreliance on technology. And that technology was blinded at a critical moment.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0What about the US \u201cpivot to Asia?\u201d Is that sort of dead now?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 No. The primary focus of the US overall, especially the military of the US,\u00a0is rightly the Indo-Pacific region, and the situation in the Mideast doesn\u2019t detract from that. I have long felt that the term \u201cpivot\u201d was not very helpful\u2014because it implies that you\u2019re pivoting away from something, and the more accurate term \u2014 and the one that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used to use \u2014 was the \u201crebalance\u201d to Asia, and that\u2019s what we should have been saying that we were doing.\n        I always also thought that it was unwise to try to leave the Middle East to the extent that we have tried, and I think we should retain a substantial force there.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 It turns out that getting out of the Middle East is something almost every recent American president wants to do, but it never really happens.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/opinions/david-petraeus-andrew-roberts-huge-challenge-facing-israel-bergen/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

View\u00a0more opinion\u00a0at CNN.", "body": "      Threats begin when reason fails.\n        The failed full-court press to install Republican Rep. Jim Jordan as House Speaker revealed ugly examples of how violent threats are becoming normalized inside Trump\u2019s GOP.\n        After Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa switched her vote on Wednesday to oppose Jordan, she issued a statement saying she received \u201ccredible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls.\u201d\n        Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado told NBC that he\u2019d received death threats as well.\u00a0 According to Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas, the strategy behind the threats is to \u201cAttack, attack, attack. Attack the members who don\u2019t agree with you, attack them, beat them into submission.\u201d\n        This is the opposite of anything resembling deliberative democracy or politics in a civil society.\u00a0(Jim Jordan, who dropped out of the race for speaker on Friday after a secret ballot found he had lost the support of his fellow Republicans as the party\u2019s choice, condemned the death threats, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong.\u201d)\n  One voicemail in particular, left for the wife of an unnamed conservative congressman \u2014\u00a0played exclusively on our colleague Jake Tapper\u2019s show \u2014 offers a portrait of the pathology that has driven the GOP into this ditch.\n        The caller, an aggrieved man, lets loose in a tirade that needs a close reading.\n        The unhinged caller begins with a lot of furious cursing and standard dehumanization \u2014\u00a0describing the anonymous congressman as a \u201cpig\u201d because he publicly opposed Jordan. The voicemail continues, with the caller suggesting that the principled decision was due to the influence of the \u201cdeep state.\u201d This is a tell that the caller has been drinking from the right-wing media well.\n        But that\u2019s basic compared to his threats to \u201ccome follow you all over the place.\u00a0We\u2019re going to be up your ass. F\u2013\u2013king nonstop. We are now Antifa. We\u2019re going to do what the left does.\u201d\n        This is a small masterpiece of projection \u2014 one that we\u2019ve seen before in the right\u2019s baseless claims that the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol was not the work of conservative Trump supporters, but members of the leftist group Antifa.\u00a0In the run-up to that attack, members of the Proud Boys even bragged that they could dress up as Antifa.\n        The bogeyman that is the fear of Antifa has become mainstream, with conservatives often\u00a0invoking the group\u00a0or other figures they associate with the left as a scapegoat for\u00a0or distraction from\u00a0violent actions on the right\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a tactic sometimes called \u201caggressive defensiveness.\u201d\n        It\u2019s not the only illogical mind-bender. The caller repeatedly uses an anti-gay slur to describe the congressman to his (*checks notes*)\u00a0wife, reflecting the insecure mindset that masquerades as being uber macho, accusing those who are more left-leaning as being gay and therefore weak in that twisted worldview.\n        That\u2019s not all. The fanatic threatening violence also accuses the congressman of being a \u201cwarmongering piece of s\u2013-t\u201d\u2014\u00a0perhaps reflecting the post-Trump isolationist impulses on the far-right. In the next breath, however, he says that the war in Israel creates moral urgency to push through a Jim Jordan speakership.\n        Then comes the threat of doxxing. The caller says that he and unnamed others are uploading the wife\u2019s personal contact information to the internet to guarantee more harassment. This is a fear-based play from a crank who wants to seem like a member of the majority by intimidating people he disagrees with.\n        Any sense that this was a random unhinged person without a partisan political agenda was demolished by his demand that the congressman vote for \u201cJim Jordan or more conservative.\u201d This caller has explicit right-wing ideological demands.\n        If the wife doesn\u2019t succeed in switching the congressman\u2019s vote, he promises that \u201cyou\u2019re going to be f\u2013-king molested like you can\u2019t ever imagine.\u201d\n        Molested. As in sexually assaulted. And then, after a beat in which you can practically hear the gears turning in his head, the caller says, \u201cAnd again, non-violently.\u201d\u00a0This is a cynical move of the kind that allows January 6th\u00a0apologists to point to Trump saying the armed crowd should march on the capitol \u201cpeacefully.\u201d\u00a0It is a legalistic non-sequitur designed to distract from obvious intent.\n        The reason I\u2019ve run through all the elements of this threat-scape is because it reflects live-wire associations from the far-right media ecosystem. The disparate threads are all there, with the intent of intimidating people to do their will\u00a0\u2014\u00a0turning over more power to the far-right.\n        It didn\u2019t work this time. But it has in the past. After the attack on the Capitol, a Republican member of Congress told a colleague he was afraid to vote to certify the election, despite his personal, fact-based belief that Biden\u2019s win was legitimate, because he was afraid for the safety of his family.\n        Similar fears drove Republicans to not vote their conscience in Trump\u2019s second impeachment. As former Congresswoman Liz Cheney told CNN, \u201cIf you look at the vote to impeach, for example, there were members who told me that they were afraid for their own security \u2014 afraid, in some instances, for their lives.\u201d\n        So while it\u2019s notable that this effort to strongarm support for Jim Jordan failed, the attempt to normalize threats of violence are still ongoing. Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who\u00a0the House select committee on January 6 found\u00a0sent text messages confirming his involvement in the plot to overturn the 2020 election results, dismissed the death threats as being a \u201cred herring.\u201d      Jake Sherman, founder of Punchbowl News, reported that Jordan ally Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio said behind closed doors that it wasn\u2019t Jordan\u2019s fault that members of Congress were getting death threats; they had brought it upon themselves by opposing him.\n        This is the politics that Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric\u00a0has wrought\u00a0among his supporters in\u00a0the Republican Party. It reflects the furious worldview that right-wing media sells to keep its listeners addicted to the anger and anxiety, turning much of the GOP into what Utah Sen. Mitt Romney calls \u201ca pro-authoritarian party.\u201d\n        These threats of violence often use fear, promising elected officials not just physical harm, but the loss of power, reinforced by the secondary threat that they will lose their partisan primaries if they don\u2019t bow to the base.\n        This is unsustainable. But coming forward and refusing to be intimidated is a step toward breaking this hyper-partisan fever. It is a hopeful sign that Jordan couldn\u2019t ultimately win even a majority of the Republican caucus when it was put to a secret ballot. Bullies only respect strength\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and threats are really admissions of weakness, if they are called out with the confidence that comes from moral clarity and a determination to defend our democracy.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/21/opinions/violent-threats-tell-us-about-the-gop-avlon/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest\u00a0opinion takes\u00a0of the week from CNN and other outlets.", "body": "      It was the speech President Franklin D. Roosevelt never gave. In a radio address scheduled for April 13, 1945, the fourth-term president would have said, \u201cIf civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships \u2014 the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together and work together, in the same world, at peace.\u201d\n        But the day before, Roosevelt was sitting for a portrait at his cottage in Warm Springs, Georgia, when he suddenly slumped in his chair, the victim of a stroke. He didn\u2019t live to see the allies\u2019 victory in World War II that year or the conference in San Francisco that month that established the United Nations.\n        Roosevelt originally conceived of the UN as a muscular force to keep the peace, with the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom and China acting as \u201cfour policemen\u201d to rein in nations that would otherwise go to war. He wanted, in the words of the undelivered April 13 speech, \u201can end, forever, to this impractical, unrealistic settlement of the differences between governments by the mass killing of peoples.\u201d\n        The world in 2023 is a much different place, but peace, as Roosevelt envisioned it, remains elusive. A two-week-old conflict in the Middle East has already claimed thousands of lives against the backdrop of a multipolar web of alliances and rivalries in which the world\u2019s major powers often lack the ability to restrain conflict, and sometimes even encourage it.\n        On Thursday evening, though, President Joe Biden, who was a toddler when FDR died, sounded a Rooseveltian tone in asserting that the US still bears a special responsibility for seeking to promote world peace. He proposed billions in new aid to both Ukraine and Israel.\n        \u201cWe\u2019re facing an inflection point in history \u2014 one of the moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come,\u201d Biden argued. \u201cAmerican leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us, America, safe.\u201d\n        Biden spoke just after returning from a trip to Israel to demonstrate support for an ally mourning the loss of more than 1,400 people in the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack. But his diplomatic efforts to meet with Arab leaders came undone after a devastating explosion at a hospital in Gaza. While Israel released evidence that the blast resulted from a rocket misfired by militants in Gaza and US officials signaled agreement, that did not tame the fury of the Palestinians and their supporters in the region.\n        What\u2019s next?\n  Seth Moulton, a Marine Corps veteran and a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, says there are urgent lessons from America\u2019s 2003 war in Iraq.\n        \u201cIsrael is about to start an invasion of Gaza with the same mission we had in those early days in Iraq: defeat the enemy, or in Netanyahu\u2019s words,\u00a0\u2018crush and eliminate\u2019 Hamas.\u201d\n        \u201cBut the lesson America quickly learned in Iraq and Afghanistan was that you have to have a plan for the day after. Outside the southern Iraqi city of Najaf during the invasion, then Colonel David Petraeus famously asked,\u00a0\u2018Tell me how this ends\u2026.\u2019\u201d\n        \u201cThe next year, I found myself in that same city Petraeus had conquered, trying to win it back. It was my second of what would become four tours in Iraq, facing far worse combat than we saw during the invasion.\u201d\n        The origins of the two wars are very different, Moulton pointed out, but there is the commonality that in a war with insurgents, some tactics can backfire.\n        \u201cNobody wants to see five-year-old Palestinian kids killed in the crossfire with Hamas, especially if their deaths only recruit more terrorists.\u201d\n        \u201cAnd nobody wants to see five-year-old Israeli kids dying, in the same forever war, 20 years from today.\u201d\n        Israeli analyst Shmuel Rosner observed that \u201cIsrael says its goal is toppling Hamas, and Biden is no doubt asking: What comes later? Biden himself initially\u00a0supported the US 2003 war in Iraq\u00a0only to end up as the president who ordered the US pullout of Afghanistan. In the 20 years in between, he witnessed the two countries that the US invaded struggle to transform their leadership from one government to another. He is familiar with the cost involved, the chaos, the bloodshed\u2026 he surely wants to see a convincing answer to the question of the day after.\u201d\n        Biden\u2019s trip to Israel and Oval Office speech \u201cshow\u00a0a confident, experienced commander-in-chief projecting gravitas and a deep knowledge of history,\u201d according to David Mark. \u201cBiden\u2019s efforts stand out even more than usual since his likely 2024 Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has been clumsy and ineffective in trying to insert himself into these news events, as when he\u00a0praised Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terror group\u00a0based in Lebanon, in the wake of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel. At the same time, the Republicans in office are in disarray as an increasingly embarrassing Republican leadership struggle in the House has paralyzed Capitol Hill.\u201d\n  Hani Almadhoun, who grew up in the Gaza Strip, now lives in the US and works as director of philanthropy at the\u00a0United Nations Relief and Works Agency USA.\u00a0\u201cIn the northern reaches of Gaza,\u201d he wrote, \u201cover 20 members of my extended family seek shelter under the refuge of a staircase\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a frail shield against the relentless and merciless storm of airstrikes.\u201d\n        \u201cThey tread cautiously, avoiding windows and the desolate streets where the overwhelming stench of death, fire and chaos hangs heavy in the air\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cThe negative impact of this war on my family in Gaza is hard to overstate: hospitals running out of space for the dead and injured, pushing the local hospitals to\u00a0use ice cream trucks to preserve the bodies.\u201d\n  Yasmine Mohammed, whose father was born and raised in Gaza, observed that \u201csince Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel, as I have read post after post on social media referring to Hamas as\u00a0freedom fighters\u00a0involved in anti-colonial resistance, I have been struck by the devastating weight of this lie. It is an insult to Palestinians to refer to these terrorists as our freedom fighters.\u201d\n        \u201cAt the hands of Hamas, the\u00a0Jewish people\u00a0have endured horrors\u00a0not seen since the Holocaust. And, like the Nazis, Hamas does not view Jewish people as human beings. According to\u00a0its 1988 covenant, every Jew must be eradicated from this earth.\u00a0Its goal is not the genocide of Jewish people in Israel; its goal is the genocide of all Jewish people on this planet, period\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cHamas is not Gaza, and Gaza is not Hamas. Gaza is an area of land with people who are trying to do the best that they can to survive under abysmal circumstances. Gazans are just human beings, like their Israeli neighbors. They want to live in a peaceful environment where they do not have to be concerned about the safety of their children.\u201d\n        When comedian Pete Davidson was 7, his father, a New York City firefighter, died responding to the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. As Dean Obeidallah noted, that gave Davidson\u2019s cold open on last week\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d a haunting resonance.\n  \u201cIn a time when social media is filled with people saying they stand with one side or the other, Davidson instead made a plea to stand for humanity,\u201d Obeidallah observed.\n        Davidson said, \u201cI saw so many terrible pictures this week of children suffering \u2014 Israeli children and Palestinian children \u2014 and it took me back to a really horrible, horrible place.\u201d He added, \u201cNo one in this world deserves to suffer like that, especially not kids.\u201d\n        Wadea Al-Fayoume,\u00a0a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy was stabbed to death last weekend outside Chicago by his family\u2019s landlord, \u201da 71-year-old man who\u2019s been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other crimes,\u201d wrote Khaled A. Beydoun. \u201cThe attacker also stabbed Wadea\u2019s mother more than a dozen times. She\u00a0lived. But what does that word even mean anymore?\u2026 What does \u2018living\u2019 mean for\u00a0millions of Arabs and Muslims who call the United States home, burdened with the impossible task of proving their allegiance, over and over again, in response to bellowing demands that bury our humanity?\u201d\n        \u201cIt feels like we are living on borrowed time, like we were extended a contingent citizenship that can be stripped at any time, on account of events that unfold in America or on the other side of the world.\u201d\n        For more:\n  Mukesh Kapila: War didn\u2019t look like this when the Geneva Conventions were writtenFrida Ghitis: Zelensky\u2019s inescapable new realityNicole Hemmer: Why student protests against Israel are so painful, polarizing and complicatedKobi Michael, a longtime intelligence and security analyst for Israel, told Peter Bergen that Hamas used \u201cmore than 2,000 terrorists from the special unit of Hamas, the\u00a0Nukhba,\u201d \u2014or more than half the unit\u2019s total manpower \u2014 to carry out its attack on southern Israel.\n        \u201cWhat was the strategic aim of such an operation, considering that they knew for sure that the price tag would be very high and they were endangering their very existence? I\u2019m sure that Hamas was sure that the shock and horror of this operation and the casualties that they would cause would be interpreted by all the Palestinians, that this was a sign from God that this was the time to open all the battlefronts and to fight Israel and this will be the end of the state of Israel. They were sure about it.\u201d\n        Bergen wrote that \u201cKhaled Hroub,\u00a0a\u00a0Palestinian academic and the author of \u2018Hamas: A Beginner\u2019s Guide,\u2019\u00a0says he believes that Hamas did not expect that the October 7 attack on Israel would be the scale that it became, and the\u00a0group didn\u2019t have a plan\u00a0for what came afterward.\u201d\n        Neither Israel nor Hamas have \u201ca very clear plan for what happens down the road,\u201d Hroub said. \u201cEven if the Israeli military succeeded in destroying Hamas, the question facing everyone is, what\u2019s next?\u201d\n        The election of Jim Jordan as House speaker seemed \u201cto make perfect sense in the era of Trump,\u201d wrote Julian Zelizer.\n        \u201cJordan is as MAGA as they come. Indeed, he was doing MAGA along with the\u00a0Tea Party long before Trump\u00a0came to town. He has been a\u00a0staunch opponent of reproductive rights, a fervent\u00a0believer in radical deregulation, a\u00a0climate change denier, a culture wars soldier and anything-goes politician who believes government shutdowns are just part of the normal price of business.\u201d\n        Yet through three embarrassing ballots on the House floor, and after his allies in the party and the conservative media tried to squeeze the anti-Jordan members to flip in his favor, Jordan failed to gain the 217 Republican votes needed to win the post. On Friday afternoon, he lost another vote \u2014 a secret ballot among his GOP colleagues to remain the party\u2019s nominee for speaker \u2014 and was essentially forced to drop out.\n  \u201cThe question is what has gone wrong? Intimidation, bullying and political pressure certainly can work,\u201d Zelizer noted. \u201cJust look at the Republican who is by far and away the\u00a0leading contender\u00a0in the race to become the nominee for his party in 2024, former President Donald Trump.\u201d\n        \u201cIt is not a mystery that Trump has built an entire career on the power of intimidation. If you are against him, he will put all his effort in destroying you. If you stand in his way, he rallies his supporters to make it clear that you will not survive being his opponent.\u201d\n  John Avlon pointed to the intimidation tactics used against Republican legislators who refused to vote for Jordan, including an expletive-filled voicemail left for the wife of one congressman, which CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper played on air. \u201cThis is the politics that Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric has wrought among his supporters in the Republican Party,\u201d wrote Avlon. \u201cIt reflects the furious worldview that right wing media sells to keep its listeners addicted to the anger and anxiety, turning much of the GOP into what Utah Sen. Mitt Romney calls \u2018a pro-authoritarian party.\u2019\u201d\n  SE Cupp said, \u201cRepublicans are squarely to blame for where they are today, more interested in punishing each other than they are in governing or solving problems. But, what if Democrats somewhere down the line are given an opportunity to step in and restore some functionality to the House?\u201d They should take it, Cupp argued.\n        \u201cThe American people aren\u2019t stupid \u2014 they can see the mess Republicans have created for themselves. But at the end of the day, they\u2019ll grow tired of intransigence and dysfunction in Congress. And eventually, Democrats will get the blame for that, too.\u201d\n        Sidney Powell drew fame in the closing days of the Trump administration for her bizarre election-denier claims and her threat to \u201crelease the Kraken.\u201d      She never unveiled the promised evidence of fraud in the 2020 election and was instead criminally charged in Fulton County, Georgia, along with Trump and 17 other co-defendants for their alleged attempts to overturn the state\u2019s 2020 election results. On Thursday, Powell \u201creleased\u00a0herself from the case by\u00a0pleading guilty\u00a0to six misdemeanor offenses and agreeing to testify truthfully against her codefendants as part of her plea deal,\u201d wrote legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers.\n        \u201cPowell\u2019s testimony is hugely important and her plea is a big breakthrough for prosecutors. She is the first cooperating witness who was part of the limited group that met with Trump to craft the plans to overthrow the election. She was also present at an\u00a0infamous meeting\u00a0at the White House on December 18, 2020 that devolved into a screaming match.\u201d\n        A day after Powell\u2019s plea, attorney Kenneth Chesebro pleaded guilty to a felony charge of conspiracy, admitting that he took part in a scheme to create a slate of fake pro-Trump electors with Trump, Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman.\n        On Monday, the former president had suffered another setback when the judge hearing the federal election interference case imposed a \u201cgag order\u00a0on Trump, limiting his ability to publicly attack special counsel Jack Smith, Smith\u2019s staff, court personnel and potential witnesses in the case related to Trump\u2019s alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election,\u201d wrote Jill Filipovic. \u201cIt\u2019s not a muzzle of Trump\u2019s ability to speak in general, but it is a demand that he not smear those involved in the case against him\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cThe decision to gag a defendant should not be taken lightly, nor infused with politics. It is crucial that Trump, as odious and dangerous as I personally find him, have the ability to fully campaign: to criticize his opponent, to criticize the system and to make the case for putting him back in the White House. Principles like the importance of free speech cannot bow to political preferences.\u201d\n        \u201cBut freedom has never existed without any limitation.\u201d\n  David Goldblatt: The people Olympic host cities don\u2019t want you to seeAmy Bass: What Mary Lou Retton will always mean to usAmy Klein: Why \u2018Old Dads\u2019 made me so madJudge Glock: The perfect storm hitting homebuyersHolly Thomas: Bearing the weight of all our hopes, the \u2018Frasier\u2019 revival never stood a chanceRichie Hofmann: The poet who found truth in death, seasons, teaching and even \u2018Schitt\u2019s Creek\u2019AND\u2026      De Niro.

Scorsese.\n        Could the Hollywood icons who collaborated on the new movie, \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d possibly match the high drama of David Grann\u2019s 2017 book by that name?\n        It chronicled the White settlers who murdered and stole from members of the oil-rich Osage tribe in Oklahoma in the 1920s and the excruciating effort to achieve a bit of justice. \u201cTo convey that gravitas,\u201d wrote Noah Berlatsky, \u201cMartin Scorsese has very self-consciously made an Important Movie. Leonardo\u00a0DiCaprio\u00a0and Robert De Niro give big, Oscar-eyeing performances. And the runtime is 3 hours and 26 minutes\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a marathon apparently designed to bludgeon viewers into submission with meaning.\u201d\n  \u201cThe heavy-handed approach, unfortunately, tends to squeeze a lot of the nuance and insight out of its source material\u2026\u201d      \u201cDiCaprio\u2019s performance is all sideways looks and shuffling evasion, with moments of dashing charm. It\u2019s very well done, and, again, well-designed to wow the Oscar committee,\u201d noted Berlatsky.\n        \u201cBut should a movie about systemic racist violence really be focused on the Oscar-turn of the White villain? Scorsese has repeatedly, and with some justice, lambasted the sameness of blockbuster superhero films. But \u2018Killers of the Flower Moon\u2019 reveals that Scorsese\u2019s narrative, genre-anchored, humanist approach to big, important filmmaking has serious limitations as well.\u201d\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/opinions/biden-channels-his-inner-fdr-opinion-column-galant/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

Read\u00a0more opinion\u00a0at CNN.", "body": "      Most of the headlines this past week concerning former President Donald Trump\u2019s legal woes have focused on developments in two of his\u00a0four criminal cases.\n        Last Monday, in the federal 2020 election subversion case, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan\u00a0imposed a narrow gag order\u00a0to restrict Trump from making public statements attacking potential witnesses, prosecutors and court personnel. (On Friday, the judge\u00a0put a temporary hold on this gag order to give the defense and prosecution more time to brief her on the issue after Trump appealed the order.)\n        Later in the week, there were potentially significant developments in Trump\u2019s criminal case in Fulton County, Georgia, where he\u2019s charged with 13 felonies\u00a0over alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election in that state.\u00a0Two of Trump\u2019s co-defendants\u00a0in that case \u2014\u00a0Sidney Powell\u00a0and\u00a0Kenneth Chesebro\u00a0\u2014 pleaded guilty to various charges and pledged to testify for the prosecution in future cases, which could include Trump\u2019s.\n        (Trump has denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to\u00a0state\u00a0and\u00a0federal\u00a0charges stemming from attempts to overturn the 2020 election.)\n        But the case that may pose the greatest threat to Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2024 is not one of his criminal cases. Rather, it\u2019s a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0in Colorado that not only saw some bad news for Trump last week but also is scheduled to start trial this month.\n        This\u00a0case\u00a0involves a lawsuit initiated by\u00a0a liberal watchdog group\u00a0on behalf of six Colorado voters to disqualify Trump from holding office by way of\u00a0Section 3 of the 14th Amendment\u00a0over his role in events leading to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n        It seeks to block him from the 2024 primary ballot in Colorado over the amendment\u2019s provision disqualifying from future office\u00a0US officials who have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution if they have \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d and/or \u201cgiven aid or comfort\u201d to insurrectionists.\n        On Friday,\u00a0 Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace\u00a0rejected\u00a0three arguments by Trump and the Colorado GOP to dismiss the case before the scheduled October 30 trial date. One of the most powerful points the judge made was rebuffing the argument that state officials have no discretion over who is placed on the ballot if a political party wants that person listed.\n  In her ruling, Wallace wrote, \u201cIf the Party, without any oversight, can choose its preferred candidate, then it could theoretically nominate anyone regardless of their age, citizenship, residency.\u201d She added, \u201cSuch an interpretation is absurd; the Constitution and its requirements for eligibility are not suggestions, left to the political parties to determine at their sole discretion.\u201d\n        And Wallace \u2014 to the likely chagrin of Trump \u2014 cited in support of this point a\u00a02012 opinion\u00a0from Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, when he was a federal appellate judge. In that case, Gorsuch\u00a0wrote\u00a0that states do have the legal authority to \u201cexclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office.\u201d\n        Wallace did not, however,\u00a0conclude that \u201cthe Fourteenth Amendment can be used to exclude a presidential candidate from the primary ballot, or that the Secretary of State is empowered to evaluate such a question.\u201d Those issues \u2014 and others \u2014 are to be decided in the upcoming trial.\n        But this suit \u2014 if successful \u2014 could be more of a threat to Trump\u2019s candidacy than his criminal cases. Why? Trump could be convicted in any of his criminal cases, yet there\u00a0is no constitutional prohibition\u00a0that bars him from running for president. In fact, Trump\u00a0could be in prison\u00a0and still run.\n        However, if Trump loses this case over the 14th\u00a0Amendment \u2014 or any of the similar ones in states such as\u00a0Michigan and\u00a0Minnesota\u00a0\u2014 his name would not appear on the ballot in those states since he would be deemed constitutionally disqualified to be a candidate for president.\n        Trump still has a motion pending to throw out the Colorado lawsuit, and his\u00a0campaign has criticized\u00a0the Colorado judge\u2019s rulings.\u00a0\u201cShe is going against the clear weight of legal authority. We are confident the rule of law will prevail, and this decision will be reversed \u2014 whether at the Colorado Supreme Court, or at the US Supreme Court,\u201d a Trump campaign spokesperson said. \u201cTo keep the leading candidate for President of the United States off the ballot is simply wrong and un-American.\u201d\n        But regardless of the decision in Colorado, even\u00a0legal scholars\u00a0who have opined that Trump violated Section 3 of the 14th\u00a0Amendment have acknowledged that ultimately this issue must go to the US Supreme Court for a final decision. And that is the way it should be given the importance of this issue. But the Colorado case could be the one that makes it to our nation\u2019s highest court.\n        To those who dismiss the prospect of Trump being disqualified from the ballot, check out the case of former New Mexico elected official\u00a0Couy Griffin, who had been the head of a group called Cowboys for Trump.\n        A lawsuit was brought against Griffin alleging he violated Section 3 of the 14th\u00a0Amendment over his actions in connection with the January 6 attack. After a trial was held, the judge concluded \u2014 based on expert testimony \u2014 that the January 6 event was an \u201cinsurrection\u201d as\u00a0contemplated by the 14th Amendment, which\u00a0was ratified in 1868\u00a0after the Civil War.\u00a0Section 3 of the 14th Amendment\u00a0was intended to keep former Confederates from holding office after the war.\n        In 2022,\u00a0Griffin was found guilty\u00a0of a misdemeanor of trespassing on US Capitol grounds but was acquitted\u00a0of a second misdemeanor charge of disorderly and disruptive conduct.\n        The judge\u00a0deemed\u00a0Griffin to have \u201cengaged in\u201d the insurrection by his conduct of being on the Capitol grounds. As the judge\u00a0explained, \u201cOne need not personally commit acts of violence to \u2018engag[e] in\u2019 insurrection. \u2026 Engagement thus can include non-violent overt acts or words in furtherance of the insurrection.\u201d\n        Consequently, Griffin was removed from office as a commissioner\u00a0in Otero County\u00a0and barred from being on the ballot in the future in New Mexico. The September 2022 ruling marked the first time an elected official had been removed from office for participation or support of the Capitol riot. The state\u2019s Supreme Court\u00a0rejected\u00a0Griffin\u2019s final appeal to overturn the decision earlier this year.\n        To those who think it\u2019s undemocratic to ban officials from the ballot if they are found to have violated the 14th Amendment, I have two responses. First, it\u2019s far more undemocratic to \u201cengage in\u201d an insurrection designed to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. And second, we can\u2019t ignore the conditions clearly imposed on candidates set forth in the US Constitution. At least, not if we want to remain a democratic republic.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/opinions/trump-colorado-ballot-lawsuit-14th-amendment-obeidallah/index.html", "section": "opinions"}
{"title": "      Opinion: Scorsese\u2019s \u2018Killers of the Flower Moon\u2019 does a disservice to its source material\n    ", "author": "", "published_on": "  Updated\n        10:39 AM EDT, Mon October 23, 2023\n    ", "abstract": "  Editor\u2019s Note: Noah Berlatsky (@nberlat) is a freelance writer in Chicago. The views expressed here are his own. View\u00a0more opinion\u00a0articles on CNN.", "body": "      \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d\u00a0is about an important topic: a series of horrific murders in the Osage Nation in the 1920s. To convey that gravitas, Martin Scorsese has very self-consciously made an Important Movie. Leonardo\u00a0DiCaprio\u00a0and Robert De Niro give big, Oscar-eyeing performances. And the runtime is 3 hours and 26 minutes\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a marathon apparently designed to bludgeon viewers into submission with meaning.\n        The heavy-handed approach, unfortunately, tends to squeeze a lot of the nuance and insight out of its source material. David Grann\u2019s thoughtful, painful nonfiction account, which inspired the film, is much more humble in ambition. But for that very reason, it leaves space for a less familiar, and less comforting story about collective, rather than individual;\u00a0evil;\u00a0and the petty hatreds, small as life, which enable the accumulation of death.\n  A finalist for the National Book Award, Grann\u2019s 2017 book is structured more or less as a detective story. The Osage\u00a0tribe were forced off lands in the Ohio and Mississippi River\u00a0valleys and settled in supposedly worthless land in Oklahoma. When they discover oil there, however, the Osage people become wealthy.\u00a0That sets the stage for unscrupulous locals to target\u00a0many of\u00a0them for their share of the oil wealth, or \u201chead rights.\u201d Tom White, an agent in the nascent FBI, comes from Washington to investigate deaths that seem to center around the family of\u00a0Mollie Burkhart. His investigation specifically leads him to\u00a0Mollie\u2019s husband, Ernest, and Ernest\u2019s uncle, William King Hale, a wealthy community leader and philanthropist.\n        If that was all there was to the story, it would fit into Hollywood White savior narratives fairly easily, with Tom White as the hero bringing villainous gangsters to justice. But Grann,\u00a0a staff writer for The New Yorker,\u00a0very deliberately\u00a0avoids that route. Instead, the conclusion of his book presents evidence that Hale was far from alone.\n        Because of racism, the Osage were deemed legally incompetent to\u00a0handle their own affairs, and forced to get\u00a0their\u00a0money only through designated local White\u00a0guardians. Osage people also had little recourse in the racist court system. This created huge incentives for graft and even for murder.\n        Hale and\u00a0Burkhart were caught and sent to prison for a time. But Grann doesn\u2019t believe they were the only killers. Instead, White people cultivated what Grann calls \u201ca culture of murder\u201d involving doctors, judges, sheriffs\u00a0and virtually everyone at the state level and beyond. Ultimately, various federal officials and Tom White himself were complicit in a system which incentivized the dispossession and brutalization of Osage people, whose wealth was seen as an unacceptable affront by White society.\n        Grann\u2019s book, with its reliance on a detective genre of singular culprits and courtroom justice, is insufficient to encompass the crime against the Osage.\u00a0Grann can try to trace the outlines of injustice, but his pages are too small to contain it, or even describe it fully.\n        Scorsese doesn\u2019t totally abandon those insights. He shows how being forced to go through\u00a0White guardians to access their money humiliates the Osage and makes them vulnerable. He adds a coda which acknowledges that not every villain in the piece is brought to justice. But he doesn\u2019t really follow up on those threads, or use them to acknowledge the limitations of his own project.\n        Instead, he defaults to\u00a0that standard Scorsese genre, the gangster picture. Having cast De Niro as Hale and DiCaprio as\u00a0Burkhart, the director has committed himself to focusing on the bad guys. And so he does. We\u2019re treated to a lot of De Niro uttering good-natured slick threats as he did in Scorsese\u2019s \u201cGoodfellas.\u201d There\u2019s also a scene with a paddle that more or less consciously evokes one of De Niro\u2019s more famous set pieces with a baseball bat in \u201cThe Untouchables.\u201d (This sequence is very much not in the book.)\n  DiCaprio gets the most screentime in a role that again has precedent in Scorsese\u2019s oeuvre. He\u2019s the conflicted antihero who is maybe little more than a villain, in the tradition of DeNiro in \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and \u201cRaging Bull\u201d\u00a0or Ray Liotta in \u201cGoodfellas.\u201d Film\u00a0Burkhart \u00a0truly does love his wife; his relationship with\u00a0Mollie (Lily Gladstone) is sweetly romantic and also corrupted by greed and abuse in ways that\u00a0Burkhart isn\u2019t willing to admit even to himself. DiCaprio\u2019s performance is all sideways looks and shuffling evasion, with moments of dashing charm. It\u2019s very well done, and, again, well-designed to wow the Oscar committee.\n        But should a movie about systemic racist violence really be focused on the Oscar-turn of the White villain? Scorsese has repeatedly, and with some justice, lambasted the sameness of blockbuster superhero films. But \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d reveals that Scorsese\u2019s narrative, genre-anchored, humanist approach to big, important filmmaking has serious limitations as well.\n        There are\u00a0films that\u00a0deal thoughtfully with genocide and structural violence:\u00a0For example,\u00a0Joshua Oppenheimer\u2019s \u201cThe Act of Killing,\u201d Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski\u2019s \u201cIda,\u201d Alain Resnais\u2019 \u201cNight and Fog.\u201d Those are all films which resolutely avoid pulp gestures, celebrity turns, and easy questions about the origin of evil, much less easy answers. In contrast, Scorsese\u2019s focus on individual character and internal moral struggle is ill-suited to a story about White supremacy and the way in which individual evil is a collective endeavor\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a\u00a0structure of permission, hate, envy and discrimination which is so horrible in part because it\u2019s so\u00a0undramatic. Ernest\u00a0Burkhart isn\u2019t a fascinating conflicted villain; he\u2019s just another White guy whose entire community agrees that he\u2019s entitled to take what he wants from people who aren\u2019t White.\n        Grann understood that. He doesn\u2019t spend much time speculating in his book about\u00a0Burkhart\u2019s \u00a0motives or\u00a0Burkhart\u2019s soul.\u00a0Scorsese, though, wants a sweeping epic; he wants drama, deep character development, profound human insight. \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d has all the expected hallmarks of a quality Scorsese film. It\u2019s complete; it\u2019s controlled. Which is why, perhaps, it feels like it doesn\u2019t do justice to the Osage\u2019s story,\u00a0which, as Grann realizes, is defined by absences, erasures and narratives that can never be told now, no matter how long you make a movie\u2019s run time.\n  Correction: This essay has been updated to correct that the Osage people became wealthy through their discovery of oil in Oklahoma.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/opinions/killers-of-the-flower-moon-scorsese-morality-berlatsky/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

My taste in books runs a fairly wide gamut with few exceptions, one of them being mysteries. So, I was quite surprised to find myself immersed in\u00a0Louise Penny\u2019s Inspector Gamache novels, all 18 of them.\n        After I received a diagnosis for breast cancer in December of 2022, Peter, one of my closest friends, told me to read Penny\u2019s books. He assured me that the books would transport me to a different world, Three Pines, and that I would find the main character, Inspector Gamache, fascinating.\n        With my surgery scheduled for late December, I began the search to find the books in the used section of my local bookstore. I found comfort in seeing the pile of books on my nightstand grow as I successfully hunted them down. Knowing that I would not run out of books, no matter how many sleepless nights I might be facing, calmed me.\n        Peter was right. I fell into the trance of Three Pines; the aroma of the croissants, the caf\u00e9 au laits and the cast of characters took hold of my mind and transported me away from the fear gripping me.\n        Surgery was\u00a0followed by chemotherapy and then radiation. Between being immunocompromised and suffering side effects from my treatments, my world became quite small. With my limited energy, I plowed through one book after the next, relishing Inspector Gamache\u2019s mantra, \u201cAll will be well.\u201d I whispered these words to myself before every medical intervention.\n        On one especially uncomfortable night when sleep eluded me, I took my book and moved to an empty bedroom so as not to disturb my husband. Plumping the pillows and tucking into the twin bed, I was suddenly transported not to Three Pines, but to the bedroom of my childhood with a different book in hand,\u00a0\u201dThe Hidden Staircase,\u201d a Nancy Drew mystery.\n        My mother disapproved of Nancy Drew books, saying they were \u201cnot literature.\u201d Apparently, my local library shared her perspective because it didn\u2019t carry them. Whenever I saved enough money from my allowance, I would walk to the local five and 10 cent store and buy a Nancy Drew mystery and a Three Musketeers candy bar, another forbidden fruit in my home.\n        Climbing into bed with my contraband, flashlight in hand, I devoured my book and candy,\u00a0seeking comfort in Nancy\u2019s ability to bring order to the chaos of each book\u2019s dilemma. I don\u2019t remember the details of those books as much as learning from them that girls could solve problems and the world played fair, the bad guy always got caught.\n        The structure of these books was a stark contrast to the nightly fighting that filled my house. I was 10 years old, and my parents\u2019 marriage was splintering apart. Within the year my mother would leave without me.\n        Returning to my Louise Penny mystery that night, I realized that perhaps it was the memory of those lonely nights from my childhood that kept me from reading mystery books. I never wanted to feel fear like that again, and yet here I was afraid for what would become of my life if the cancer wasn\u2019t cured. Now the fight was within me instead of seeping through a shared bedroom wall. Could I really trust that all would be well?\n        It\u2019s been a long time since I believed the world is fair. And there is nothing fair about a cancer diagnosis. In contrast, my belief that girls can solve problems has only gotten stronger. The women physicians who took care of me are a stunning reminder of how the world has changed since my childhood.\n        But most of all, I still believe in the power of the written word to help us through dark nights when sleep is slow to come. There is no mystery in that.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/opinions/cancer-recovery-books-reading-mulqueen/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

Read\u00a0more opinion\u00a0at CNN.", "body": "      Recent Democratic presidents have sought reelection by limiting overt campaigning and instead making sure they\u2019re seen focusing on the nuts and bolts of their job. President Bill Clinton, in his\u00a0successful 1996 reelection bid, spent the late months of his campaign\u00a0negotiating legislative deals\u00a0with a Republican-majority Congress. And President Barack Obama, in late October 2012, took time off the campaign trail in his ultimately\u00a0winning bid\u00a0to lead the federal response to\u00a0Hurricane Sandy\u00a0in the Northeast.\n        A bit over a year out from Election Day 2024,\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0is taking a similar approach, by dint of a morbid and tragic pair of international crises.\u00a0By taking a lightning-fast visit to Tel Aviv on Wednesday after a similar wartime visit to Ukraine a few months earlier, and making a primetime appeal to American voters Thursday to support both Israel and Ukraine in their wars against evil forces, Biden is reaping political dividends by\u00a0playing\u00a0the statesman.\n        Biden\u2019s efforts stand out even more than usual since his likely 2024 Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has been clumsy and ineffective in trying to insert himself into these news events, as when he\u00a0praised\u00a0Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terror group\u00a0based in Lebanon, in the wake of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel. At the same time, the Republicans in office are in disarray as an increasingly embarrassing Republican leadership struggle in the House has paralyzed Capitol Hill.\n  Biden, in contrast, appears capable and steadfast. For 20 months, he has been a\u00a0stalwart defender\u00a0of Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia. And for nearly two weeks Biden demonstrated steely\u00a0support for Israel\u00a0as the Middle East\u2019s only democracy responds to Hamas\u2019\u00a0October 7 attacks\u00a0that claimed some 1,400 lives, among then 32 Americans. He noted during his TV address that his\u00a0quick trip\u00a0to Israel is the first of an American president to the country during war-time, while his touchdown in Ukraine in February was the first time a US president entered a warzone not controlled by the US.\n        Whatever\u00a0effect they have on the diplomatic front, Biden\u2019s\u00a0Israel trip\u00a0and Thursday night prime time\u00a0television address\u00a0can only help his reelection efforts at this point, especially if he faces Trump.\u00a0Both show\u00a0a confident, experienced commander-in-chief projecting gravitas and a deep knowledge of history, having made official\u00a0visits to Israel\u00a0going back to 1973 as a freshman senator from Delaware.\n        Biden made the long journey\u00a0despite predictable criticism\u00a0that he\u2019s tilted too far in Israel\u2019s direction at the expense of the Palestinians. Arab allies who he\u2019d hoped to meet with instead snubbed him, and Muslim protesters have taken to the streets in cities around the world in opposition to Israel and its American backers.\n        Many observers also said he didn\u2019t achieve much, but in Biden\u2019s roughly seven-and-a-half hour Israel visit\u00a0Wednesday, in which he met government officials,\u00a0first responders\u00a0and families of terror victims, among others, he was able to secure his two main goals: to reassure the Israeli public he stood with them and against terrorists, giving them strength for the fight as well as space to\u00a0demand concessions if needed. And he also hammered out a\u00a0limited plan for getting humanitarian aid into Gaza from Egypt\u00a0for civilians effectively trapped in the small territory, which will hopefully serve as a template for more to come.\n        But Biden\u2019s key audience was the domestic one. He wanted to win over the American public, and pro-Israel community specifically, which is why images of the president\u00a0hugging\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are so politically potent.\u00a0The Middle East trip by Biden, who turns 81 on November 20, also offered a none-to-subtle rejoinder to\u00a0GOP criticisms\u00a0that he\u2019s too old for a second term. (Granted, having\u00a0Air Force One\u00a0at the president\u2019s beck-and-call is an easier form of travel for the 12-hour Washington, DC,-to-Tel Aviv flight than an economy seat on El Al.)\n        Some Republicans even offered grudging praise for Biden\u2019s Israel trip. His urgent diplomatic mission sharply contrasts with House Republicans\u2019\u00a0infighting in Washington, where the inability of the majority party to\u00a0select a speaker\u00a0from among its own members\u00a0means the body can\u2019t take any steps to help the war effort. Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee even\u00a0called Biden\u2019s trip\u00a0a \u201cgutsy, bold move.\u201d\n        Biden also drew some plaudits from the right over his television address, which\u00a0directly appealed\u00a0to Americansfor support in the wars in Israel and Ukraine, including an\u00a0$100 billion aid package\u00a0he plans to send to Congress shortly (if there is a Congress).\u00a0He also underscored America\u2019s commitment to its leadership role in the world and the values it has historically promoted.\n        \u201cIt may be remembered as one of the best, if not the best, speeches of his presidency. He was firm, he was unequivocal, he was strong,\u201d Fox News political analyst\u00a0Brit Hume said\u00a0of Biden, offering rare praise.\n        Of course, many prominent conservatives still found grounds for panning the Democratic president. His trip\u00a0drew scorn\u00a0from 2024 Republican presidential candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, as well as\u00a0mockery\u00a0from Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham. \u201cHe was mumbling, reading his note cards and called Hamas \u2018the other team,\u2019\u201d Ingraham wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n        Nor has Biden been spared criticism from some Democrats. Members of the party\u2019s\u00a0far-left fringe\u00a0have\u00a0effectively blamed Israel\u00a0for taking defensive military measures against Hamas in Gaza after its terror attacks ended in the highest Jewish casualty count\u00a0since the Holocaust.\u00a0And the progressive wing has been making inroads into the Democratic Party\u2019s support for Israel as a whole. According to Gallup, Democratic support for Israel\u00a0has been sliding\u00a0for years.\u00a0Per one CBS News poll, a majority of Democrats don\u2019t favor sending extra weapons and supplies to Israel at this time.\n        More broadly, though, Biden is capitalizing on solid political ground. Massive majorities support sending humanitarian aid to Israel and a poll released by Quinnipiac\u00a0University\u00a0on Tuesday, roughly\u00a061% said\u00a0their sympathies lie with Israel. Even more voters (around 65%) agree with Biden that supporting Ukraine is in America\u2019s national interest.\n        So, on balance, Biden\u2019s resolute support\u00a0of Israel\u00a0is likely to help more than hurt, especially as it strengthens his centrist credentials. And swing voters are the ones Biden really needs to win reelection in 2024. At the same time, there\u2019s little evidence to date that progressives will break with him over support for Israel if Trump is the 2024 Republican nominee.\n        The foreign policy moves could particularly help with voters in swing states if they read it as him pushing back against his party\u2019s most extreme elements,\u00a0as some pro-Israel Democratic members\u00a0of Congress have done. It\u2019s a political formula mastered by Democratic presidential predecessors like\u00a0Clinton\u00a0and, in his own way,\u00a0Obama, ahead of their reelection wins: Clinton agreed to compromises with the Republican Congress on\u00a0welfare reform, the Defense of Marriage Act and a range of other issues. Obama, meanwhile, at points in his 2012 campaign touted\u00a0spending austerity,\u00a0deficit reduction\u00a0and extension of George W.\u00a0Bush-era tax cuts.\n        Voters for now are giving Biden\u00a0reasonably good reviews\u00a0for his handling of both Israel and Ukraine. He has a year to make that stick \u2014 a challenging task since most presidential elections since the end of the Cold War have been decided on domestic issues, rather than foreign affairs. Moreover, the situation is volatile, and Biden could end up looking bad if suffering in Gaza increases, a wider war takes place, American forces are killed, there are terror attacks on American soil, or any number of other negative possibilities happen. But Biden, for now, is nailing a key part of the job, just as Clinton and Obama did before him: being presidential.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/opinions/israel-gaza-biden-ukraine-russia-mark/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

I knew that look well.\n        Like him, I\u2019m an Arab, Muslim and American \u2014 an amalgam of identities that conjures up \u201cpariah\u201d in the world we live in. But now, it means something different. At this moment, when\u00a0the horror of mass death unfolds in Gaza\u00a0and on screens we hold in our palms, our identity spells absurdity.\n        We see ourselves in the people of Gaza. The accosted people there share our names, our faith, our culture and our customs. We have friends in that\u00a0140-square-mile\u00a0open-air prison turned into hell on earth, including\u00a0journalists who were sheltering at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital\u00a0at the time of the deadly blast on Wednesday.\n        But what we continue to see on our screens is still half a world away. On the other side of our terrestrial reality and this virtual insanity.\n        Until this past week.\n        \u201cA Palestinian boy was killed in Illinois,\u201d shared Abed. This sequence of foreign-to-domestic murder was a familiar one. Being American, like 6-year-old\u00a0Wadea Al-Fayoume\u00a0was, does not protect us from the stigma of being Palestinian or Arab, Muslim and from the \u201cMiddle East.\u201d Rather, these latter identities keep the security blanket of Americanness away from us, rendering us foreign and, during times of crisis, \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n        Wadea was stabbed 26 times last Saturday with a military-style knife by his family\u2019s landlord, a 71-year-old man who\u2019s been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other crimes. The attacker also stabbed Wadea\u2019s mother more than a dozen times. She\u00a0lived. But what does that word even mean anymore?\n        What does it mean for a mother who escaped war for the safety of an American suburb? What does it mean for Abed and I: an executive director of a civil rights\u00a0organization\u00a0and a law professor, standing at the crosshairs of American power and an Arab identity conflated with terrorism? What does \u201cliving\u201d mean for\u00a0millions of Arabs and Muslimswho call the United States home, burdened with the impossible task of proving their allegiance, over and over again, in response to bellowing demands that bury our humanity?\n        It feels like we are living on borrowed time, like we were extended a contingent citizenship that can be stripped at any time, on account of events that unfold in America or on the other side of the world.\n        Calling it \u201cIslamophobia\u201d would be a severe understatement. This existential ballad of being Arab or Muslim in America is far more onerous, far more absurd. It feels like an existence that has\u00a0no exit. A play where our daily routine is waking up to the news of war, the stark images and videos of slain children, rolling timelines of shattered villages and the roaring demands \u201cto condemn Hamas.\u201d While this plot sounds a lot like novels from Jean Paul Sartre or Albert Camus, this is not fiction.\n        This is our absurd reality.\n        An absurd reality where we, in America, can only post on virtual timelines where the footsteps of suspicion stomp out our voices and censor our speech.\n        Our names and nationalities, faces and faith brand us with the stain of collective guilt for crimes that we did not commit. Moments like this \u2014 like the\u00a0aftermath of 9/11\u00a0or the reckoning after former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0Muslim Ban in 2017\u00a0\u2014 moved many to conceal their ethnicity or\u00a0cover\u00a0their faith, particularly women who removed their hijabs or young children who hid behind aliases. Hate crimes statistics skyrocketed after 9/11, and\u00a0reached\u00a0near proportions in the wake of the Muslim Ban.\u00a0Wadea\u2019s death foreshadows that these figures may spike again, and descend on the heads of Arab and Muslim Americans shadowed by suspicion.\n        But we cannot shed our bodies.\u00a0These are the corporal vehicles that connect us to the victims cast as villains in Gaza. And the symbols that tie us to distant places where \u201cwars on terror\u201d were wrought yesterday and are certain to wreck more lives tomorrow.\n        \u201cMuslims are only newsworthy when villains, never victims.\u201d I wrote those words, for the first time, as a law student weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks. I was much younger then, unprepared for what the world would come to be.\n        But I knew then that it would never be the same.\n        I typed those very eight words 20 years later in my\u00a0book, \u201cThe New Crusades: Islamophobia and the Global War on Muslims.\u201d\u00a0In between the wide-eyed optimism of a young law student and the sobered worldview of an aging law professor, 9/11 and today\u2019s war serve as bookends for morbid middle passages for Muslims in America and around the globe \u2013 as evidenced by the genocidal\u00a0campaigns\u00a0in China, persecution\u00a0in India, hijab and\u00a0abaya\u00a0bans in France, and far more.\u00a0The law and language of Islamophobia\u00a0have been\u00a0exported transnationally by an American \u201cwar on terror\u201d that was first enforced on the home front, upon the heads of Arabs and Muslims like me whose citizenship was cast aside.\n        Being American was no protection. Not then and definitely not now.\n        The barrage of cold stares and commands to condemn terrorism, assignment of collective guilt and characterization of our dead children as \u201ccollateral damage,\u201d not only strips us from the\u00a0substance\u00a0of citizenship, it renders us inhuman. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have ideas,\u201d wrote Carl Jung, \u201cIdeas have people.\u201d\n        And the idea that conflates our skin with terrorism not only grips the imagination of people, but sinks into the very marrow of American gates of power. We must\u00a0exist, whatever that even means anymore, within the very lines that divide our identities and sever us from normalcy.\n        While I am in Washington and not Chicago, I can feel every one of those 26 stabs that plunged into little Wadea\u2019s body. While across American cities large and small,\u00a0we\u00a0see ourselves in the grieving parents forced to bury their dead children in Gaza.\n        This is what it means to be us.\n        Perhaps it is time that this country begins to see us.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/21/opinions/how-arab-muslim-americans-feel-war-beydoun/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

As Sarah Jaffe pointed out in\u00a0Columbia Journalism Review, \u201cwhile reserving a separate space for \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019 meant that things like parenting, fashion, and the beginnings of the feminist movement got column inches, the separation also demarcated the women\u2019s page as the site of less newsy content.\u201d\n        Women journalists, at the time, were acutely aware of the risk of marginalization; more than a few enterprising reporters used this to their advantage, covering everything from war to sports from \u201cthe woman\u2019s angle.\u201d\n        The debate over the so-called \u201cpink ghetto\u201d continues today: Should we celebrate or bemoan the proud history of excellent reproductive health coverage in women\u2019s magazines? What does it mean when a story on equal pay is tagged under \u201cgender\u201d rather than \u201ceconomy\u201d? Is the\u00a0Style\u00a0section really the most natural fit for news of a leadership transition at Planned Parenthood?\u00a0As news outlets chronicle the devastation of the Israel-Hamas war, what will it take to see more mainstream reporting on the disproportionate toll of violent\u00a0conflict\u00a0on women and girls?\u00a0      The issues that affect women\u2019s lives are relevant to people of all genders \u2014 but it\u2019s clear that women\u2019s media outlets still have an essential role to play.\u00a0Ms.\u00a0Magazine was born out of a frustration that, in the words\u00a0of founder Gloria Steinem, \u201cthere really was nothing for women to read that was controlled by women.\u201d More than five decades later, the magazine is still going strong. Blogs like\u00a0Jezebel\u00a0and Feministing\u00a0launched careers, built community and provided a forum to cover issues like\u00a0abortion\u00a0with twice the nuance and none of the \u201cboth sides\u201d false equivalency of \u201cmainstream\u201d media outlets.\n        Many of the same journalists who got their start writing for feminist blogs or women\u2019s magazines (and some who still write for feminist blogs and women\u2019s magazines) are shaping coverage of presidential elections, providing sharp analysis of Supreme Court cases and breaking down complex policy issues for a wide range of platforms. When we see a byline from\u00a0Anna Holmes,\u00a0Erin Gloria Ryan,\u00a0Irin Carmon,\u00a0Jia Tolentino,\u00a0Laura Bassett,\u00a0Mattie Kahn,\u00a0Rebecca Traister,\u00a0Roxane Gay\u00a0or so many others,\u00a0we know we\u2019re in for a smart take on what\u2019s happening in the world.\n        Over the years, it\u2019s been heartening to see coverage of issues like\u00a0reproductive rights,\u00a0paid leave,\u00a0care work\u00a0and the\u00a0#MeToo\u00a0movement begin to make headlines in some of our country\u2019s most prestigious legacy media outlets (and even the occasional\u00a0men\u2019s magazine). It sends a message when a chilling\u00a0story\u00a0about a 13-year-old sexual assault survivor unable to access abortion is on the homepage of TIME, The New York Times spotlights child care\u00a0and\u00a0girlhood, CNN dedicates precious time and resources to investigative\u00a0reporting\u00a0on systemic gender inequality and The Washington Post puts the Black maternal mortality crisis front and\u00a0center.\n        If we\u2019ve seen progress when it comes to moving so-called women\u2019s issues from the margins to the mainstream, it\u2019s thanks in no small part to generations of mostly (though not only) women reporters willing to battle the powers that be, force important stories onto the front page, and insist that women\u2019s news is, well, news. And as thankful as we are to every exhausted reporter continuing to push this particular boulder up the hill, the onus shouldn\u2019t be on them.\n        As media companies compete for readership and fight to stay afloat, appealing to women isn\u2019t just a nice thing to do \u2014 it\u2019s a business imperative. In a 2020\u00a0report,\u00a0\u201cThe Missing Perspectives of Women in News,\u201d researcher Luba Kassova found that \u201cwomen are lighter news consumers than men globally.\u201d She wisely suggests: \u201cThis could be due partly to news being produced mainly by men, and focusing mainly on men \u2013 a problem exacerbated by the data gaps in understanding women\u2019s news needs.\u201d In other words, news outlets have some serious catching up to do when it comes to understanding half their potential audience.\n        In a recent\u00a0viral appearance, comedian Chelsea Handler told Jimmy Fallon: \u201cI think we are in a very important cultural moment, you know, with women dominating culture.\u201d\n        Consider the many articles that popped up this summer analyzing the financial\u00a0ripple effect\u00a0of Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d; Coco Gauff\u2019s\u00a0US Open\u00a0win; and Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9, whose tours together generated more than an estimated\u00a0$9 billion\u00a0in economic activity.\n        Women make up\u00a0slightly more than half\u00a0of the US population, have\u00a0out-voted men\u00a0in every presidential election of the past 60 years and control more than\u00a0$10 trillion\u00a0in household assets. (For more on the role of women in the economy \u2014 and the challenges that persist \u2014 check out the research of newly-minted Nobel Laureate, Claudia Goldin.) In a crowded media landscape, outlets that spend time talking \u2014 and listening \u2014 to women are well-positioned to identify breaking news before it breaks, a reality on vivid display in the days following last summer\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson decision.\n        Heading into a presidential election where abortion will be\u00a0a defining issue\u00a0\u2014 if not\u00a0the\u00a0defining issue \u2014 this is a moment when every media outlet should be racing to expand its gender coverage, not backing away.\n        So what can readers do to encourage this? We can start by holding outlets accountable, demanding that they cover \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d with the rigor they deserve and employ reporters from all backgrounds \u2014 not just for the good of their own coverage but for the sake of our democracy, which benefits from having more voices in the conversation.\n        We can support platforms like The\u00a019th\u00a0News,\u00a0The Meteor\u00a0and\u00a0Rewire News Group, along with smaller independent outlets (we\u2019re big fans\u00a0of Jessica Valenti\u2019s\u00a0Abortion, Every Day). We can champion reporters covering these issues by reading their work and sharing it far and wide. And, of course, let\u2019s not forget that\u00a0publications such as Glamour,\u00a0Cosmopolitan,\u00a0InStyle,\u00a0Teen Vogue,\u00a0Elle,\u00a0Ebony\u00a0and\u00a0Essence\u00a0have long been ahead of the curve in juxtaposing in-depth political and health reporting with stories on fashion and entertainment. (Full disclosure: We have proudly written for, subscribed to, and otherwise supported many of these platforms.)\n        The day The Lily\u00a0posted\u00a0their last Instagram message,\u00a0the comments\u00a0section was awash in heartfelt reflections. \u201cI always read them and used their information in our work of women\u2019s rights activism in Venezuela,\u201d one commenter lamented. Reporters thanked The Lily for giving them their first big byline, or taking a chance on a topic other media outlets had deemed unimportant. \u201cYou guys are making me cry\u00a0\ud83d\ude2d\u00a0Thank you for all you did for young women in journalism\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f,\u201d read one response.\n        There were notes of gratitude for The Lily\u2019s coverage of Black women\u2019s health, LGBTQ families, postpartum anxiety, birth control and a host of other topics too often overlooked by media outlets. One commenter put it succinctly: \u201cThank you so much for seeing us.\u201d\n        That\u2019s the power of great reporting: It can hold a mirror up to society and shine a light on the unseen. The headlines we read help shape politics and public opinion, upend cultural norms and inspire people to act. Ultimately, gender coverage is too important to\u00a0be either/or; it has to be both/and. It matters how these stories are told\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and by whom, and where. We need an abundance of platforms like The Lily, serving as a complement to reporting on gender woven through every section: news, opinion, technology, health, politics, business, the arts. In the interim, wherever outlets place their gender coverage, one thing is clear: We need more of it, not less.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/21/opinions/the-lily-media-women-gender-coverage-richards-peterson/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

{"title": "      Opinion: I\u2019ve sacrificed for a Hollywood acting career. This is where I draw the line\n    ", "author": "", "published_on": "  Updated\n        3:47 PM EDT, Sun October 22, 2023\n    ", "abstract": "Editor\u2019s note: Mehdi Barakchian is a New York-born actor, comedian and producer who has appeared in numerous screen productions. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\u00a0", "body": "      Earlier this month, striking writers ratified a deal with major Hollywood studios that was greeted with excitement throughout the entertainment community. In a year of multiple strikes, it represented a major win for workers fighting growing income inequality.\n        Now, it\u2019s the actors\u2019 turn to reach a deal with studios \u2014 except that the studios have suspended talks with SAG-AFTRA, the union representing us.\n        The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) walked away from the bargaining table on October 11 and studio executives said they were suspending discussions because they were \u201cno longer moving\u201d forward \u201cin a productive direction.\u201d In short, the actors and studios remain in a stalemate.\n        In case you haven\u2019t followed the actors\u2019 strike, the AMPTP and SAG-AFTRA are negotiating revenue sharing and policies around use of artificial intelligence (AI), among other items. Until we get a deal, actors like me remain on the picket lines. And as long as we\u2019re on the picket lines, a lot of great shows won\u2019t be filmed, and a lot of folks who rely on this industry will be out of work.\n        Maybe you\u2019re thinking \u201cwait, I thought actors make tons of money?\u201d Well, sure, it can be millions and millions of dollars \u2014 if you\u2019re an A-lister. Most of us don\u2019t come anywhere close.\n        In my case, you may not know my name, but you might recognize my kind-of-familiar face from one of the shows I\u2019ve appeared in. Some have been pretty big hits over the last five years, including the supernatural drama series \u201cManifest,\u201d the psychological thriller series \u201cYou,\u201d and \u201cModern Love,\u201d an anthology series about human connection.\n        I\u2019m fortunate to have enough success acting full time that I\u2019ve been able to pay my bills and acquire health insurance. Back when my bookings were really booming, I proposed to my now wife and added a dog to our family \u2014 the typical sorts of things people do when they have financial stability.\n        But it\u2019s never been easy for the average actor to afford the conventional trappings of middle-class life \u2014 and it\u2019s getting harder all the time. One big problem for actors is that the business model for Hollywood film productions has completely changed, but the contracts have not. That\u2019s why actors went out on strike in July, a couple of months after the writers did.\n        Suffice to say, my not working for the past few months has been a financial hardship on my family. But the roughly 160,000 actors on strike are enduring what we hope to be a short-term pain for long term gains in pay, benefits and job protection. We miss the profession that we love, but we can\u2019t continue to work in conditions that compensate us less than our due and in an industry that fails to safeguard our careers as it embraces AI in a way that potentially could threaten our livelihoods.\n        A lot of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars are on the picket lines too, lending us their moral support, for which I\u2019m grateful. They are fighting with us for fair wages in an industry where the average salary in 2022 was a paltry $27.73 per hour for actors in California, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. But most actors don\u2019t work a 40-hour work week, 12 months a year, so those stats may not fully capture just how precarious our livelihood is.\n        Acting is a notoriously tough profession to break into and maintain long-term security. Most of us who could were likely able to make a living did so because we were paid a fair wage based on viewership.\n        Prior to the advent of streaming, actors like me relied on residuals paid out based on how often we appeared in a show and how successful it was. That meant essentially, the more views, the more money we earned.\n        But the contracts we are operating under do not consider the dramatic increase in streaming numbers and the decline of network and cable viewership. In short, actors work much more to make ends meet and still sometimes find ourselves earning less.\n        When streaming first showed up, it had a lot of work to do to draw and maintain audiences. At the time, most of us were working in cable and network TV, which is where the audiences were. That large viewership, and the usage residuals this model provided, is why a lot of us were able to make a living. But the business has completely changed.\n        Last year, streaming in the US surpassed cable and network TV in viewership. Many actors depend on residuals from previous programs but in the streaming era, that income has fallen precipitously.      This immense shift has changed the model, and the AMPTP, which represents movie and television producers, including Disney, Warner Brothers and Netflix (CNN\u2019s parent company is Warner Bros. Discovery, which produces movies and television shows.) And even as studios say that they\u2019re being squeezed financially, CEOs continue to earn tens of millions of dollars.\n        Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA says 86% of its members don\u2019t qualify for health care coverage through the union, because they don\u2019t qualify under SAG-AFTRA\u2019s income threshold, which is about $26,500 a year.\n        What\u2019s more, many of us live in the most expensive cities in the country like Los Angeles and New York, because that\u2019s where the work and industry infrastructure exists. The average one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles rents for about $3,000 per month, according to rent.com, which comes to $36,000 per year. So, if you\u2019re a Hollywood actor barely scraping by \u2014 well, you can do the math.\n        Another major sticking point is how the industry would like to use AI. The AI proposal from the AMPTP impacts the most marginalized and financially vulnerable performers in the entertainment industry \u2014 background actors.\n        Obviously, the way in which actors\u2019 images will be used is a hugely important issue. SAG-AFTRA negotiators say the proposed contract would pay background actors for a day\u2019s work (they currently are paid at the rate of less than $200 per day), scan their body and use that image any way they want for the rest of the project. The union has also said that the studios want to own that scan to use for perpetuity, without the consent of the background actor and without providing further compensation. The AMPTP rejected this claim, and has said that they will require consent from the actor and the replica would only be used in the movie they signed up for.\n        But here\u2019s a sobering thought: AI technology is still incredibly young. We have no way of understanding or knowing what can be done with this information in 10, 20, or 30 years. The potential is limitless and protections for real people need to be put in place now.\n        You might be thinking, \u201cWith all your reservations about the way the business of Hollywood is run, why don\u2019t you just get a different job?\u201d I\u2019d turn the question around and ask you, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you fight for the job you love?\u201d\n        Acting is my job. It\u2019s more than that \u2013 it\u2019s my passion. I\u2019ve done thousands of auditions, performed thousands of hours on stage to hone my craft, finished hundreds of hours of really mediocre improv classes (and some good ones too) and made a cross-country move away from everyone and everything I know to pursue this career.\n        I think a lot of people were reminded of the value of on-screen entertainment in their lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. The stories we watched on big and small screens gave us something else to talk about \u2014 a way to escape the scary reality just outside our front door.\n        Several Hollywood A-listers, including Ben Affleck, Emma Stone and George Clooney, met with SAG-AFTRA leaders this week after the studios suspended negotiations. They\u2019ve made overtures to try to end the strike, according to news reports; I\u2019m hoping that all that star power helps get the talks back on track. The idea that underpaid union workers should \u201cget a different job\u201d while industry executives earn tens of millions of dollars feels like a post-apocalyptic show written by AI. But here we are \u2014 in real life.\n        Let\u2019s be clear: this fight is about the entire ecosystem that makes your favorite onscreen entertainment run. This includes actors like me, but also casting directors, costume departments, lighting crews, camera operators, producers, teamsters, make-up artists and so many more professionals with real lives, real families and real professional goals. None of us non-executives\u00a0 get rich working in this industry.\n        I couldn\u2019t be happier for my extended family in the Writers Guild of America whose sacrifice and determination allowed them to strike a deal with the studio execs that their leaders are happy with. Until the actors can say the same, you won\u2019t find my kind-of-familiar face on screen, but on the picket line.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/opinions/hollywood-actors-movies-strike-talks-sag-aftra-barakchian/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

She is the first cooperating witness who was part of the limited group that met with Trump to craft the plans to overthrow the election. She was also present at an\u00a0infamous meeting\u00a0at the White House on December 18, 2020 that devolved into a screaming match.\n        To date, outside advisers like Powell, who supported\u00a0plans to seize voting machines,\u00a0among other things,\u00a0had maintained\u00a0in subpoenaed testimony that\u00a0their actions were justified.\n        The existence of the plea deal suggests her testimony at trial will be different \u2014\u00a0and that Georgia prosecutors are not only convinced that it is credible and reliable, but also that it can help them convict other defendants in the case.\n        As a result, Powell\u2019s plea could be devastating for Trump and her other former co-defendants in the Georgia election interference case. Her testimony could potentially play a significant role in the federal election interference case brought by special counsel Jack Smith as well.\n        The most immediate impact of Powell\u2019s plea is likely to be felt\u00a0by her co-defendants in the Georgia case, starting with\u00a0Kenneth Chesebro, the alleged architect of the fake electors\u2019 plot, whose trial starts next week.\u00a0Chesebro reportedly\u00a0rejected\u00a0a recent plea offer, according to sources who spoke to ABC;\u00a0perhaps he may reconsider now that Powell has pleaded and is prepared to testify.\n        It\u2019s not entirely clear, however, that prosecutors would use Powell\u2019s testimony at Chesebro\u2019s trial, given that the indictment does not allege that they were involved together in any specifically charged actions. Prosecutors could choose to focus more intently on the parts of the conspiracy involving Chesebro\u2014namely, the scheme to convene alternate slates of electors to be used to disrupt the election certification process.\n        Powell\u2019s cooperation is also very bad news for two other groups of defendants in the Georgia case. The lower-level defendants indicted over their actions in Coffee County, Georgia, should be very concerned about proceeding to trial with a second cooperating witness now on board, after Scott Hall, a Georgia bail bondsman\u00a0reached a plea deal\u00a0in September.\n        But more critically, Powell\u2019s interactions with Trump and his inner circle mean that the most important names at the top of the indictment \u2014 particularly Trump, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani \u2014\u00a0could be directly implicated by her potential testimony.\n        Truthful testimony by Powell should include her involvement in the plans to steal the 2020 election through false public statements, frivolous litigation, the seizure of voting machines\u00a0and the sidelining of Trump\u2019s actual legal advisers in favor of Powell and others willing to do whatever it took to succeed.\n        Powell\u2019s testimony should also include what Trump, Meadows, Giuliani and others said in meetings and other interactions in which the plot and its execution were discussed. This insider\u2019s view was something that had been previously missing, and it will likely be devastating at trial.\n        Many of Powell\u2019s past statements have been egregiously false \u2014 like\u00a0baseless claims\u00a0that the Clinton Foundation, philanthropist George Soros, and former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez were responsible for manipulating voting machines to change the results \u2014 and her connection to a key figure in the QAnon conspiracy world\u00a0must have been troubling to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis\u2019s team as they thought about her as a government witness.\n        That suggests to me that, for prosecutors to sign this deal and have confidence in Powell as a witness, Powell must have fully conceded that her prior positions were baseless and false and that she will come clean about that on the stand.\n        Powell was identified as an\u00a0unnamed co-conspirator\u00a0in special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s indictment \u2014 which means that a charge in that case may be coming.\n        If that comes to pass, it is unclear whether Powell would cooperate in that case. Just because she struck a plea deal with Willis\u2019 office doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she will do the same in the federal election interference case.\n        But the fact that Powell cooperated in Georgia does make it more likely that she will try to cooperate with Smith in exchange for some sort of deal.\u00a0 Once someone gets over the hurdle of the first guilty plea, they are much more likely to resolve other matters similarly.\n        But if federal prosecutors do charge Powell, they will be able to use Powell\u2019s plea statements and any testimony\u00a0from the Georgia case against her, leaving her with few options to fight a federal case if it is brought.\n        At a minimum, federal prosecutors will have more information to decide what to do about Powell and how to proceed, which can only help them as they move toward Trump\u2019s\u00a0March 2024\u00a0trial date.\n        Powell\u2019s legal troubles are not over. She still faces potential jeopardy in the federal election interference case,\u00a0as well as major lawsuits by\u00a0two voting\u00a0machine companies, There have\u00a0also been\u00a0efforts\u00a0to sanction or disbar her in jurisdictions in which she filed and litigated frivolous lawsuits and made defamatory claims, which may gain steam following her guilty plea.\n        But she has limited the damage to herself in Georgia, while at the same time providing prosecutors with a major weapon in their efforts to hold the rest of the defendants, including former President Trump, accountable for their conduct.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/opinions/sidney-powells-plea-is-bad-news-for-trump-rodgers/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

Couldn\u2019t a film about old dads also have included some older moms?\n        Look, being an older dad is not a new story: Men have been doing it since the\u00a0dawn of time. The biblical Abraham was 100 years old when he had Isaac. More recently,\u00a0Robert De Niro\u00a0was 79 when he announced the birth of his seventh child.\u00a0Al Pacino\u00a0was 83 when he had his fourth. Talk about \u201cThe Godfather\u201d\u2026.\n        Our culture is long overdue for some\u00a0real-talk\u00a0storytelling about older moms, because we\u2019re the\u00a0true heroes of any story about older parenting. We older moms are the only demographic increasing fertility: From 1990 to 2019,\u00a0the number of\u00a0women\u00a0ages 40 to 44\u00a0giving birth more than doubled, and women 35 to 39 saw a 67% increase, according to\u00a0the United States Census Bureau. (Women in age groups under 30 also showed a startling decrease in that time period.)\n        Like many older moms, it wasn\u2019t exactly my\u00a0first choice to\u00a0become a parent later in life: I only met my future husband at 39, and we didn\u2019t get married until I was 41. I got pregnant right away \u2014 and if I hadn\u2019t kept miscarrying for the next three years, I still would have been an older mom, just not quite as old as I was when I birthed our daughter at age 44.\n        Living in New York City, I didn\u2019t feel old being a first-time mom in my 40s \u2014 but that\u2019s because my sister and best friends also had babies at the same time (fine, they were approaching 40 and I was well past it, but still.) It\u2019s true that some people called me \u201cGrandma\u201d \u2014 an unfortunate rite of passage for all us over-40 moms, especially those not living in\u00a0big, coastal cities. But I just laughed it off.\n        What I can\u2019t laugh at is that we older mothers get so much aggravation for having children later in life.\u00a0\u201cShould we be sympathetic to a 42-year-old\u2019s fertility struggles?\u201d\u00a0That\u2019s how a writer came at me on a parenting website when I started to share my IVF journey in a weekly\u00a0column\u00a0ten years ago. Commenters weren\u2019t kind either, writing things like,\u00a0\u201cYour [sic] old and dried up,\u201d one woman wrote. \u201cAmy\u2019s journey seems to be all about herself and her needs,\u201d another opined about my wanting to be a mother.\n        That\u2019s because the narrative about older moms is that we\u2019re selfish.\u00a0 Not that we haven\u2019t found a partner, or we\u2019re trying to get out of debt to afford a child or we are having trouble getting pregnant. (Forget the fact that,\u00a0according to some studies,\u00a0sperm counts are declining.)\n        But older dads \u2014 no matter if they\u2019re octogenarians \u2014 are rarely called selfish or \u201cdried up.\u201d In \u201cOld Dads,\u201d Burr\u2019s character Jack doesn\u2019t get\u00a0grief\u00a0for being old. \u201cI always wanted to be a dad,\u201d he narrates\u00a0at\u00a0the beginning of the film, noting that it took him 46 years to\u00a0get there.\u00a0(In real life,\u00a0Burr\u00a0was 49 and 52 when he had his daughter and son.) If anyone asks Jack why it took him so long, he says, \u201cI tell them to F@#$ off.\u201d\n        Rarely can a woman tell the world to go jump in the proverbial lake. As the \u201cBarbie\u201d\u00a0movie has shown us, women usually have to apologize for our very existence (and in America Ferrera\u2019s\u00a0memorable monologue\u00a0about the challenges and misogynist traps women face, she did not even begin to discuss older moms.) When people call us selfish, or career-oriented (as if we shouldn\u2019t be working?) or blame us for our own infertility (!), we women just have to shoulder it.\n        We don\u2019t have the luxury like the men in \u201cOld Dads,\u201d such as Jack, who says he married late because, \u201cI just hadn\u2019t met the right woman yet.\u201d That\u2019s because it\u2019s okay for men to be picky in finding a partner or to focus on their careers or in fact be selfish (it\u2019s called \u201cambition\u201d for men). His wife in the film (played by Katie Aselton) believes he married late because \u201che had an unhappy childhood.\u201d\n        Hey, I had an unhappy childhood! Raised in a home with traditional gender norms before my parents ultimately divorced, I wasn\u2019t eager to take on the labor of motherhood \u2014 birthing, raising and loving kids, not to mention cooking, cleaning and planning for them, too. Like Jack, I also was a late bloomer, but as he says, \u201cI\u2019m not going to whine about it.\u201d\n        Truthfully, I don\u2019t have much\u00a0reason\u00a0to whine about being an older mother. I love it.\n        I\u2019m grateful I had my 30s to make the mistakes in dating to not have to settle; I kissed enough frogs before I met my love, an equal partner who does his share of the childcare, work\u00a0and\u00a0housework. (Like Burr, my husband was 49 when we had our daughter, but he looks half his age, and acts like it, too.)\n        I\u2019m lucky that I had time to work out my issues so I don\u2019t have to burden my kids with unresolved psychological scars. And unlike many women who have children in their 20s and early 30s, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m missing out on anything: We older moms have had more time for\u00a0travel, for climbing the corporate ladder (or whatever ladder we\u2019re on). We have invested in ourselves, and\n        are now more than ready to devote ourselves to our children and families.\n        The main problem with being an older mom \u2014 or older parent \u2014 is that we\u2019ll have less time to be with our children. But nothing is ever guaranteed; my best friend, a mom of two, died at 42, so you never know.\u00a0The topics of aging and death\u00a0aren\u2019t\u00a0addressed in \u201cOld Dads,\u201d\u00a0which ends with the old guys being forced to change with the changing times.\n        This one movie\u00a0doesn\u2019t\u00a0bear\u00a0the responsibility for addressing all the shortcomings of how we talk about older parenting, but I wish\u00a0it\u00a0addressed the lessons we older moms (and dads, my husband wanted me to add) can teach the younger generation: most importantly, to not take parenting (or ourselves) too seriously, that our children will probably be okay (look at how little parenting we Gen Xers got!) and that life and parenting are precious, no matter how old you are.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/19/opinions/old-dads-netflix-bill-burr-older-moms-klein/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

He is the author of The Dead Pledge: The Origins of the Mortgage Market and Federal Bailouts, 1913-1939. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more\u00a0CNN Opinion.", "body": "      Anyone looking to buy a house knows that this is not a great time. During the pandemic, mortgage rates were at their lowest level in\u00a0history\u00a0and housing was cheaper. It took just about 20% of the median family income to pay for a mortgage with 20% down. Today, mortgage interest rates are up \u2014 the\u00a030-year fixed rate\u00a0is currently 7.63%\u00a0\u2014 and so are home prices. Americans need about\u00a035%\u00a0of their income to pay for a mortgage, which is higher than at the peak of the so-called housing bubble in the early 2000s.\n        Unfortunately for homebuyers, there is almost no hope that we\u2019ll return to the affordable housing days of 2020. More concerning, there is little indication that recent trends will reverse or that homebuying will get much more affordable in the near future.\n        The main reason homebuyers are struggling is that the cost of borrowing has gone up for everybody. After a burst of inflation, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates at one of the fastest paces in its history. The Fed has taken its target\u00a0interest rate\u00a0from near zero at the beginning of 2022 to almost 5.5%\u00a0today.\n        But the Fed\u2019s rates mainly affect short-term borrowing. Even more important for mortgages are long-term interest rates that recently hit peaks.\n        One of the main reasons for those higher long-term rates is unprecedented levels of federal deficits and debt. This year the federal\u00a0deficit, excluding the reversal of the government\u2019s student loan forgiveness plan, hit\u00a0$2 trillion, a level once inconceivable in peacetime. The Fed has also been\u00a0reducing\u00a0its holdings of many long-term federal bonds and even\u00a0mortgage-backed securities\u00a0backed by the federal government. These trillions of dollars of bonds thrown on the market mean all sorts of borrowers have to compete for funds in a more crowded field, and therefore have to pay higher interest rates to attract investors\u2019 attention.\n        The markets are expecting the federal government to keep begging for large slugs of extra cash for years, which has helped push 10-year Treasury notes up to over\u00a04.9%, from below 1% just a few years ago. The increased interest rates for federal and other debt have pushed mortgage rates up from less than 3% during the pandemic to 7.63%.\n        In another world, high mortgage rates might have crashed the housing market and at least reduced prices for new homebuyers. But, according to the Case-Shiller Home Price Index, although\u00a0housing prices\u00a0declined a bit after a temporary peak last year, they have started\u00a0climbing\u00a0again and even hit new record highs. The median\u00a0sales price\u00a0of a house in the middle of this year was about $420,000, almost $100,000 higher than it was before the pandemic and far above its peak in the early 2000s.\n        The problem is that even though higher interest rates have not reduced home prices, they have stalled homebuilding and new house listings.\u00a0Due in part to increased financing costs, new housing construction this year will likely be\u00a0down\u00a0about 10% from its post-pandemic peak. And few people are putting their houses on the\u00a0market, since they want to keep their old, lower\u00a0mortgage rates. The lack of supply is keeping housing prices elevated.\n        The current situation amounts to a tragedy for new homebuyers. They have few housing options, and the options they do have are at new price peaks and have to be purchased with high-interest mortgages.\n        There is little sign that the driving forces behind these problems will turn around soon. Inflation is still high, so the Fed doesn\u2019t want to reduce interest rates or start repurchasing bonds in the next few months, which would drive down rates; the federal government will not get its fiscal house in order in the next few years; and there is little indication that homebuilders are ready to significantly ramp up construction again. The Mortgage Bankers Association\u00a0expects\u00a0mortgage rates will start coming down within a year, but it has had to keep revising its expectations for rates upwards.\n        Homebuyers in general should not try to time the market. If we\u2019ve learned anything in the past two decades, it\u2019s that housing prices can go up and down unexpectedly. But for those who don\u2019t have to buy right now, renting should be considered an option. Despite claims to the contrary, homebuying is not always a better financial decision than renting. Since rents have started coming\u00a0down, a comfortable rental home can be a great alternative when buying is unaffordable.\n        For those who are looking to buy, the best short-term hope is that economic and financial headwinds start to push home prices down again. Lower prices would allow homebuyers to secure high-interest mortgages now and then hope to refinance when or if rates go down again in the future. It might be slim comfort, but it is one of the few things for which potential homebuyers, including this writer, can hope.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/19/opinions/housing-market-mortgage-rates-glock/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

In this world of perpetual darkness\u00a0\u2014\u00a0largely devoid of electricity, fuel, and the internet\u00a0\u2014\u00a0my family has\u00a0now also receded from view.\n        In the northern reaches of Gaza, over 20 members of my extended family seek shelter under the refuge of a staircase\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a frail shield against the relentless and merciless storm of airstrikes.\n        They tread cautiously, avoiding windows and the desolate streets where the overwhelming stench of death, fire and chaos hangs heavy in the air.\n        When ambulances, fire departments, journalists and\u00a0UN staff find themselves bereft of protection, one can only imagine the plight of civilians like my family and dear friends in Gaza this week.\n        The negative impact of this war on my family in Gaza is hard to overstate: hospitals running out of space for the dead and injured, pushing the local hospitals to\u00a0use ice cream trucks to preserve the bodies.      Hungry cats roam the streets of Gaza crying for food.\n        And if this is not enough, our family in Gaza received a\u00a0prank evacuation call last night. It\u2019s deeply distressing to hear that in these difficult times, some are making prank calls to Palestinians in Gaza, urging them to evacuate their homes in the middle of the night under the pretense of impending bombings.\n        This has caused immense panic and fear for many families. Such actions are both heartless and unnecessary, particularly when thousands of homes have already been destroyed in Gaza.\n        We once celebrated birthdays together, shared meals, laughed and forged cherished memories.\u00a0Yet today those memories lay in ruins, much like the places that were once our sanctuaries.\n        My family, like countless others, is denied the simple privilege of reminiscing about better days as they endure another judgment day.\n        My 71-year-old mother, surrounded by most of her children and their offspring, clings to the familial bond that keeps them together as they grapple with diminishing water supplies, and the oppressive cloak of darkness that accompanies a life without electricity.\n        Their peculiar predicament places them in what is ironically deemed northern Gaza\u2019s evacuation area, though escape remains a risky endeavor for many.\n        The reasons for their inability to flee are multifaceted. The scarcity of fuel renders any vehicle moving in Gaza right now\u00a0\u2014\u00a0let alone a car spacious enough to accommodate 20 people\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a subject of suspicion. And venturing southward would lead them into unfamiliar territory, far from friends, family and the comforting familiarity of home. In a region where geography can determine life or death, this is a gamble few are willing to take.\n        In a world where not even\u00a0my\u00a0colleagues adorned with the emblem of the UN are assured safety, the conundrum faced by civilians becomes a disquieting paradox.\u00a0How can ordinary Palestinians, like my family, be expected to find sanctuary when the lines between refuge and peril blur with each passing day?\n        The struggles of the present serve as a testament to the unyielding spirit of the Palestinian people, a resilience that draws its strength from the painful memories of\u00a01948\u00a0when my grandparents fled for their lives, and\u00a01967\u00a0when our parents sought shelter within Gaza.\n        These were times of similar adversity, times when our forebears endured and survived. The question that lingers, however, is why should their children and grandchildren be condemned to relive this ceaseless cycle of suffering?\n        Looking back at those days, I have developed a deeper understanding of my relatives, who lived through the\u00a01948 Nakba\u00a0\u2013 and the uncertainty, the injustices, the powerlessness and the betrayal. Feelings instilled into a new generation of Palestinians who only grew up hearing stories\u00a0of their ethnic cleansing.\n        Now the Palestinians in Gaza\u00a0are taking a trip down memory lane, with the realization in their march toward safety,\u00a0that\u00a0they are leaving behind places that they might as well never see again.\n        The pain of loss and dispossession has been etched into our collective memory, serving as a somber and persistent reminder of our shared history.\n        Earlier this week, I received a message from Amro, my 29-year-old nephew. Amro is fond of Gaza and staying there, despite having opportunities to travel and live outside of it.\n        Amro made me promise that\u00a0if\u00a0he somehow survives this, I should help him find a way to leave Gaza forever. This was hard for me. Amro loved this coastal Mediterranean town, up until the most recent war.\n        This essay serves as a heartfelt plea for understanding, compassion, and, above all, an urgent call for peace and the hope of a brighter future.\n        Sadly, given the relentless duration of the crisis in Gaza, the prospects for such a future seem more elusive by the second.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/19/opinions/palestinian-american-family-gaza-fears-almadhoun/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

There have been plenty of opinion pieces in national outlets, with headlines like \u201cThe War Comes to Stanford\u201d and \u201cStudents for Pogroms in Israel.\u201d\n        But there have also been more material criticisms. After several Harvard student groups announced that they \u201chold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence\u201d following the Hamas attack on the country that left at least 1,500 dead, billionaire hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman and others\u00a0called for the students\u2019 names and details to be made publicly available in order\u00a0to blacklist them from future jobs \u2014 essentially also calling for them to be doxxed. A nonprofit founded by Victoria\u2019s Secret billionaire Leslie Wexner, and his wife Abigail, announced that it was\u00a0breaking ties with Harvard, alleging the school has been \u201ctiptoeing\u201d over the Hamas\u2019 attack.\n        At the University of Pennsylvania, the Huntsman Foundation (led by former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman)\u00a0withdrew\u00a0its promised multimillion-dollar donations this week, arguing that the university\u2019s delay in commenting on the attack amounted to \u201csilence in the face of reprehensible and historic Hamas evil.\u201d And as Huntsman, also a former ambassador and former Penn trustee, wrote in his email to Penn\u2019s president, \u201csilence is antisemitism.\u201d\n        Historical context matters here, because harsh reactions among the American establishment to college students and their political activism are not new to the current crisis. Student radicals have been targets of condemnation since at least the early 1960s, when they experimented with new forms of protest against anti-Black racism, the Vietnam War, poverty and censorship. \u201cI think they oughta shoot \u2018em if they\u2019re carrying the Vietcong flag,\u201d actor John Wayne\u00a0said of the protests.\n        Though they were part of pivotal movements for social change, the students themselves wielded much less power than most other people in society \u2014 certainly less than politicians, business leaders and university presidents. So why do these students receive such outsized attention?\n        In part, no doubt, it\u2019s a question of fear: fear that a rising generation will fundamentally transform the country, rewriting its politics in ways that appall the people currently in power. That has yet to bear out in reality; the 1980s and 1990s, for instance, were not decades of left-wing radicalism by middle-aged Boomers (many of whom had fought the Vietnam War), but rather an era of marked conservatism in US politics. There were, of course, cultural changes, but on the political front, it would have been difficult to guess that, say, the Democratic Party that voted for the Iraq invasion in 2003 had, 30 years earlier, been torn apart by antiwar protesters opposed to US actions in Vietnam.\n        It\u2019s fair (and important) to note that the students being criticized now for their protests are by far in the minority of their peers,\u00a0in part because\u00a0social media and news outlets have highlighted the most incendiary and shocking voices, muting the more nuanced discussions that define many of the conversations and positions held by student activists.\u00a0But watching this all play out in recent days, it seems like there is a more important dynamic at play, a different lesson derived from the 1960s. People with real power have learned, over the decades and most acutely in the last few years, to use student protests and youth-driven radicalism as a political tool, pointing to the content of protests to delegitimize entire parties and movements.\n        Students can be at times ham-fisted, doctrinaire, blinkered and strident in their protest. In the 1960s, student radicals\u00a0occasionally waved the Viet Cong flag to show solidarity with the people of Vietnam. Others flashed the Little Red Book of Mao Zedong, a Chinese leader whose policies led to millions of deaths. Such symbols became important touchstones for some students who were working to make sense of, and oppose, American imperialism, a political stance with few other outlets in the US (certainly\u00a0the two-party system had little to offer them).\n        Such techniques also made students tempting targets at a time when US soldiers were dying in firefights with the Viet Cong, and when sympathy for the millions of Vietnamese killed or displaced by the war was hard to find. An\u00a0image of a student with a Viet Cong flag\u00a0allowed supporters of the war to argue that the entire antiwar movement was actually anti-American. As a bonus, the sight of such students made it easy to dismiss young people across the country, and leftism more broadly, as uninformed, unpatriotic and unworthy of support, without ever having to engage with the students\u2019 critiques of American power.\n        There was no need to engage, because the students themselves had little power of their own. Universities could, and\u00a0did,\u00a0suspend and expel\u00a0student protesters. Police could, and did,\u00a0brutalize and arrest\u00a0them. Political parties could, and did,\u00a0ignore and overrule them (although the Democratic Party would ultimately reform its practices to allow greater representation of young people, a reform that did not dramatically change the party\u2019s politics in the years that followed).\n        But students did have the power to disrupt,\u00a0to grab camera time and to create\u00a0the iconic imagery of an era. For that reason, it was easy to imagine they had far more power than they did, easy for people with actual power and material resources to imagine themselves to be victims of these students. President Richard Nixon invoked\u00a0the \u201csilent majority\u201d in 1969, suggesting that US politics had been hijacked by the unruly, unrepresentative protestors that dominated the nightly news, that patriotic Americans had to take their country back. President Ronald Reagan\u00a0railed against\u00a0student protestors as governor of California in the late 1960s, building himself a platform to eventually become president. The students may not have gotten their revolution, but conservative politicians found them useful for gaining power of their own.\n        A similar dynamic appears alive and well today.\u00a0Students at a number of schools across the US have rallied for Palestinians, at times blaming Israel for Hamas\u2019 attack as part of a broader denunciation of the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza.\u00a0Critics in particular\u00a0have called out\u00a0National Students for Justice in Palestine for its \u201cday of resistance\u201d that explicitly celebrated the attacks and sought to lay blame for the violence entirely on Israel.\u00a0That position is offensive for most, especially for fellow students who may rightly feel alienated or horrified by their colleagues\u2019 efforts, but nothing coming from US universities has, at this point, moved the needle on national\u00a0support for Israel, which\u00a0appears to be strengthening.\n        But it has earned many students swift retribution, in the form of\u00a0lost jobs, broad condemnation and the threat of industry blacklists. It has also been used to discredit the left more broadly. For some, that\u2019s precisely the point. Christopher Rufo, a right-wing activist who has built a career on attacking universities (and for explaining in detail how he carries out his propaganda),\u00a0laid out his plan\u00a0on social media, arguing that, by connecting Hamas, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Socialists of America and academic discourse, the right can \u201cattack, delegitimize and discredit\u201d universities and the American left, turning them into \u201cpolitical untouchables.\u201d\n        Such a maneuver requires most Americans to believe that students have outsized power, that they have the potential to orchestrate the nation\u2019s politics and so must be shut down at any costs by those who disagree with these students\u2019 political causes.\u00a0That simply isn\u2019t the case. You may hate these student activists\u2019 words and actions, but they\u2019re not the ones with the power here. We should be focused on the people who do have that power, and on how they\u2019re using it.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/opinions/israel-palestinians-hamas-gaza-college-student-protests-hemmer/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

Speaking to me on Sunday, Hroub also said that\u00a0Israel\u2019s expected ground invasion of Gaza\u00a0doesn\u2019t seem to incorporate any planning for the \u201cday after\u201d the war is over.\n        Hroub was born in Bethlehem in the West Bank in a refugee camp, and his\u00a0family moved to Jordan and then to the UK, where he completed his doctorate at the University of Cambridge. He is a professor of Middle Eastern studies at\u00a0Northwestern University\u2019s campus\u00a0in Doha, Qatar.\n        Hroub told me he believes that\u00a0Hezbollah\u00a0in Lebanon on Israel\u2019s northern border will not get involved in the war in a large-scale way unless the Gaza conflict drags on for many weeks. If it does, he said, the pressure on Hezbollah to fight Israel will increase.\n  Our interview was edited for length and clarity.Peter Bergen: What do you think about the scale and timing of the Hamas attack in Israel?Khaled Hroub:\u00a0My analysis is Hamas did not plan this attack to be as large as it was. I think they planned something limited; they wanted to do something short, swift and effective.\n        They had been planning for this for a long time, but once they penetrated Israel, they were surprised by the ease of the operation. The operation spread in different directions without prior planning.\n        Once the operation became larger than planned, it appeared that there was no clear second phase to this Hamas operation. There was no clear-cut political goal or demand behind it. So, it looked like an ad hoc expansion of what had started to be the kidnapping of some Israeli soldiers and then swapping them for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. They were surprised by their own success.\n  Bergen: So, who\u2019s in charge of Hamas\u2019 operations? Is it\u00a0Mohammed Deif, an elusive Hamas military commander?Hroub:\u00a0It is hard to tell because the media focuses on\u00a0Mohammed Deif, but Hamas has\u00a0a collective leadership\u00a0at the end of the day.\n        Israeli policy seems to target these Hamas leaders, thinking they are solely responsible. So, if we assassinate this guy or that guy, things will be dramatically different. Over the years, this theory has been proven wrong. So, the more the\u00a0Israelis assassinate Hamas leaders, the more a new generation comes in, even younger and maybe even more radical.\n  Bergen: You said in the past that when Israel undertook previous large-scale military operations in Gaza, it backfired because\u00a0it strengthened Hamas. Do you think that situation is going to be different this time?Hroub:\u00a0I think neither Israel nor Hamas had a very clear plan for what happens down the road. Even if the Israeli military succeeded in destroying Hamas, the question facing everyone is, what\u2019s next?\n        So instead of having one single address now in Gaza that you can deter \u2014 Hamas does have institutions \u2014 you will end up with a bunch of splinter groups, certainly more radical than Hamas, and without any method of deterring them. So, this is why I think Israel doesn\u2019t have a clear plan for the second phase of whatever invasion they might do.\n  Bergen:\u00a0The 2006 Palestinian elections\u00a0were won by Hamas.\u00a0The George W. Bush administration\u00a0had encouraged that election but was surprised by Hamas\u2019 success. What was the\u00a0impact of that election?\u00a0Hroub:\u00a0I think it led to the situation that we are facing at this very moment. Why is this? If you go back to the context, the regional and global atmosphere back then was dominated by the so-called war on terror, led by George Bush. This war was fought in countries and against groups, including Hamas.\n        The other campaign of George Bush\u2019s administration was the region\u2019s democratization. So, these two efforts were going hand in hand for the Bush administration: One was the democratization of the Middle East, and the other was the campaign against terrorism.\n        So, Hamas used the Bush democratization campaign to protect itself from the heat of the war on terror, and they won the 2006 elections and\u00a0came into power in Gaza.\n  Bergen: Why did Hamas win the elections in 2006?Hroub:\u00a0Hamas\u2019 victory in 2006 was not only the appeal of Hamas; it was the failure of the PLO and the Palestinian Authority in delivering\u00a0their promises of having a Palestinian state.\n        Israel also did not fulfill its promises to the Palestinians, and there was no hope. Even Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Yitzhak\u00a0Rabin, who signed the\u00a01993 Oslo peace accords\u00a0moving forward the\u00a0peace process,\u00a0was assassinated by an Israeli. And since then, you have\u00a0right-wing politics dominating\u00a0the Israeli scene. So that was another kind of failure.\u00a0      A third party that failed was the US. The US did not care about\u00a0the perspective of the Palestinians. These multiple failures fed into the popularity of Hamas.\n        Palestinian voters also hated the corruption of the Palestinian Authority and its failure in bringing about a Palestinian state, and they wanted an alternative: Hamas,\u00a0which was seen as not corrupt\u00a0and also adhering to resistance against Israel.\n        Now the image is different, of course, because Hamas has been in power for 16 years, and people have\u00a0mixed views about Hamas\u2019 performance.\n  Bergen: What is the role of religion in Hamas?Hroub:\u00a0Very central, the mother organization of Hamas is the\u00a0Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood, which was founded in Jerusalem in 1945. During the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and most of the 1980s, they did the business of any other traditional branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, meaning working in charities, mosques, student unions and professional associations.\n        But they never adopted a resistance strategy against Israel, which meant that during this period, they had a dubious reputation among the Palestinians because they were not resisting Israel.\n        What changed was the gradual Islamization of Palestinian society, and in 1987, when the\u00a0first Palestinian uprising happened, they changed their strategy and adopted resistance.\n        Since then, we have had these two tendencies within\u00a0Hamas. One is nationalist; the other is religious. In times of crisis and war, the religious component comes to the forefront at the expense of the political and nationalist components.\n  Bergen:\u00a0US Secretary of State\u00a0Antony\u00a0Blinken\u00a0was in the Qatari capital, Doha, last week. The Qatari government has a relationship with Hamas and has also had success in brokering deals\u00a0to get hostages and prisoners released; for instance,\u00a0five Americans held by Iran were released\u00a0last month. Do you think there\u2019s some possibility there, or is the war too advanced for that discussion to happen in a meaningful way?\u00a0Hroub:\u00a0I think it\u2019s still kind of very early to talk seriously about this issue. Hamas will be very stubborn because the only concrete outcome that could come from this confrontation is to free Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. And this doesn\u2019t fit with the mood nowadays dominating Israel. So, I think it\u2019s a bit too early.\n  Bergen: Do you think Hezbollah stays on the sidelines mostly during the war against Hamas, or that can change?Hroub:\u00a0Hezbollah may get involved the longer the war goes on. If it goes on for three, four weeks, things might change.\n  Bergen: Is peace at all possible here in the longer term?\u00a0Hroub:\u00a0Since the killing of Rabin, the idea of\u00a0a two-state solution on the Israeli side\u00a0has been continuously going down the drain.\n  Bergen: What happens to those living in Gaza?Hroub:\u00a0There are many kinds of local voices calling upon\u00a0the Palestinians not to leave Gaza, telling them, \u201cIf you leave, you will never come back.\u201d\u00a0The Arab countries\u00a0are extremely sensitive to taking more Palestinians into their territories, whether in Egypt or Jordan.\n  Bergen: Do you think this Hamas attack on Israel was an intelligence failure or a policy failure by the Israelis, or both?Hroub:\u00a0I think both.\n        It was a policy failure because you have had Palestinians caged in Gaza\u00a0since 2007, without any hope, and in that long period of 16 years, you have conditions in the Gaza Strip (going) from bad to worse by the day; they blame, of course, Israel\u2019s blockade of Gaza, but there\u2019s also a fair share of the blame on Hamas, which failed to provide employment and other services.\n  Youth unemployment in Gaza is 60%, the\u00a0highest in the world. There is no hope whatsoever. So, Hamas wanted to do something to break this deadlock, even if it was very dramatic. If they freed their prisoners from Israel, they could at least bring in something not only for Gaza but also the Palestinians.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/opinions/palestinian-analyst-hamas-hroub-bergen/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

Unlike behemoth contemporaries\u00a0(notably\u00a0\u201cFriends\u201d), the show has survived the two decades since its finale with its reputation almost entirely unblemished.\n        Few sitcoms have ever won such resounding critical acclaim, and no comeback show ever has. That is, unless you count\u00a0\u201cFrasier\u201d\u00a0itself.\n        As dedicated fans know, the character\u00a0of\u00a0Frasier\u00a0Crane\u00a0originated in \u201cCheers,\u201d the classic\u00a01980s sitcom about regulars at the titular Boston dive bar. \u201cFrasier\u201d followed\u00a0him to\u00a01990s Seattle, where he moved\u00a0in with his father Martin, a retired cop played by the late John Mahoney, and\u00a0rekindled\u00a0his relationship\u00a0with his snooty brother Niles\u00a0(David Hyde Pierce), an also successful (but strictly off-air) psychiatrist.\n        \u201cFrasier\u201d\u00a02.0, which recently debuted on Paramount+,\u00a0sees Crane back in Boston after a dazzling TV career and a less-dazzling breakup. Once again,\u00a0he\u2019s\u00a0surrounded by an entirely new main cast, most notably\u00a0Frasier\u2019s\u00a0son Freddy (Jack Cutmore-Scott), who\u2019s now a fully-grown Harvard dropout-turned-firefighter.\u00a0Grammer slips back into the role like a beloved Armani suit,\u00a0and many of the ingredients for the old magic are there. Whether they\u2019ll coalesce this time around is another matter.\n        Much\u00a0of what made the original \u201cFrasier\u201d so comforting was its insularity. Frasier and Niles\u00a0ruminated\u00a0about the inexpert new server at Cafe Nervosa, bold additions to the menu at Chez Henri and Seattle\u2019s opera program, not\u00a0Bill\u00a0Clinton\u2019s second term or Britney Spears\u2019 rise to world domination.\n        It\u2019s a sleight of hand also favored by perennials like \u201cCheers,\u201d \u201cCommunity\u201d and \u201cModern Family,\u201d and in principle, it\u2019s a wise move. The less time spent in the real world, the more soothing the viewing experience \u2014 and the less jarring a rewatch five, 10 or 30 years on.\n        In the first few episodes at least, the reboot\u00a0heeds the same wisdom. We don\u2019t know who\u2019s president, we\u2019ve not heard about TikTok and there are no clunky references to current pop culture.\u00a0But Frasier 2.0 will only prove a true refuge from the 2023\u00a0news cycle if it can fill its apolitical bubble with emotional substance.\n        The original\u00a0\u201cFrasier\u201d swerved a meaty chunk of contemporary discourse, but made up for it with a simmering undercurrent of class politics.\n        The tension between Frasier and Niles and their blue-collar father was a necessary rebuff to what would otherwise have been a deafening cacophony of self-indulgence. Their frivolous lifestyles were an unflattering contrast to that of Martin\u2019s caretaker, working-class Mancunian Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), whose relentless daily grind was constantly interrupted by Frasier\u2019s entreaties to \u201cget the door.\u201d\n        The result was a joyous vacillating harmony: Niles\u2019 secret love for Daphne often saw him abandon his prissy inclinations, and Frasier usually (eventually) conceded his father\u2019s wisdom. Frasier\u2019s producer Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin) didn\u2019t hesitate to check anyone, but saved her choicest\u00a0lines\u00a0\u2014 \u201cWell excuse me for not being rich enough to shop at the international house of tight ass\u201d \u2014\u00a0for Niles and Frasier.\n        That balance is harder to pull off 30 years later with a group boasting far more\u00a0homogenous\u00a0socioeconomic\u00a0status. Freddy has taken Martin\u2019s place as the chalk to Frasier\u2019s cheese, but in order to reheat the dynamic, the new show has flattened his original quirks.\n        Freddy has morphed from the dorky natural heir to Frasier and his astringent ex-wife Lilith to an American everyman who wants to eat off a hockey table \u2014 and it\u2019s not entirely clear how that happened.\n        Freddy\u2019s roommate,\u00a0young\u00a0single mom Eve (Jess Salgueiro), might offer a dose of realism, were it not for the fact she\u2019s also a bartender-slash-actor and apparently surviving without too much trouble after the year 1995.\n        Niles and Daphne\u2019s son David (Anders Keith), is a direct sub-in for the most absurd iteration of his father, and was presumably inoculated at birth against the unpretentious influence of his mother. Frasier\u2019s new colleagues Alan (Nicholas Lyndhurst) and Olivia (Toks Olagundoye) are Harvard professors. A rare flaw of the original has been cured in that the lead cast is no longer entirely\u00a0White, but in other respects, it\u2019s arguably less diverse.\n        Frasier 2.0 is so eager to\u00a0establish\u00a0the lay of the land that it\u00a0paints\u00a0in far broader strokes. Alan, Frasier\u2019s old Oxford chum, continues the irritating tradition instated by Daphne\u2019s drunken brothers for boozy Brits, and we gather almost immediately that\u00a0Olivia is picking up Roz\u2019s mantle as \u201cthe horny one.\u201d\n        There\u2019s far less subtlety off the bat compared to the 1993 lineup, whose foibles and vulnerabilities were revealed with such wonderful restraint over the course of years.\n        In a way, it\u2019s understandable that the new show is hasty to\u00a0reveal\u00a0its hand. There\u2019s a ton more television around now than there was three decades ago, and if audiences don\u2019t latch on immediately, there\u2019s an almost endless array of alternatives available at a scroll. And for all its exposition, it is funny.\n        David\u2019s laminated allergy card \u2014 \u201cthe red ones are fatal\u201d \u2014 is vintage, and by the standards of TV in general, the script sings. But that was never the\u00a0bar\u00a0this revival\u00a0would be held to.\n        There\u2019s no doubt that audiences in 2023 are primed for a fresh dose of comfort TV.\u00a0Re-watching\u00a0\u201cFrasier\u201d proved a\u00a0popular resort\u00a0during the pandemic, and this year\u2019s\u00a0challenges\u00a0are scarcely more bearable. But while I\u2019m eager to give the new series a chance, I\u2019m not convinced it has the same scope to envelop us in its own sequestered world.\n        \u201cFrasier\u201d was a cocoon, but one so rich with nuance, intimacy and lyricism that you could happily dive into it without any of your mental faculties feeling underserved. It seems unlikely the reboot can attain the same depth. But then, almost no TV show ever has.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/opinions/frasier-revival-kelsey-grammer-comfort-tv-thomas/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

To that end, let me introduce two more concepts from the annals of American history:\u00a0political realignment\u00a0and\u00a0deadlocked conventions. Both are venerable terms among historians and political scientists, but how do they matter in 2023? More importantly, what can they tell us about what comes next in the House of Representatives?\n        The answer to that last question, in short, is more deadlock in the House and the possible collapse of the Republican Party as we know it.\n        First, let\u2019s consider the concept of\u00a0political realignment.

Roosevelt\u2019s ascendancy in 1932.\n        But in fact, realignment had been occurring much earlier, dating back at least to the\u00a0deadlocked election\u00a0of 1800 between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, and continuing through the beginning of the modern Democratic Party in 1828 with the\u00a0triumphant election\u00a0of Andrew Jackson.\n        Yet the period between 1852 and 1860 is\u00a0crucial\u00a0here, for it saw the last time a major political party collapsed (the Whig Party in 1854) and the dissolution of another political party (the Democratic Party\u00a0in 1860).\n        Let\u2019s start with the Whigs, whose\u00a0epic collapse\u00a0is still the stuff of historical legend. Despite having won two presidential elections and counting such notables as Daniel Webster, Henry Clay and Lincoln among their ranks, by 1854 the Whigs had become hopelessly divided into Northern and Southern factions over the issue of slavery.\n        The tipping point came with the passage of the divisive\u00a0Kansas-Nebraska Act\u00a0that permitted slavery\u00a0in all western territories.\n        The result was electrifying. The anti-slavery Whigs\u00a0felt\u00a0that the party had not gone far enough to resist the expansion of slavery, and they eventually coalesced into the Republican Party.\n        Southern Whigs, for their part,\u00a0joined\u00a0an anti-immigrant party (the American Party) or switched to supporting the Democrats. Whig partisan William Henry Seward, who would go on to become Lincoln\u2019s\u00a0secretary of state, was\u00a0content\u00a0to let his party die: \u201cLet, then, the Whig party pass. It committed a grievous fault, and grievously hath it answered [for] it. Let it march out of the field, therefore, with all the honors.\u201d\n        The collapse of the Whig Party soon signaled more divisions to come. In 1860, the Democratic Party\u00a0deadlocked\u00a0in its national convention in Charleston, South Carolina.\n        Appealing to the \u201csovereign states of the Union,\u201d Alabama secessionist William L. Yancey\u00a0demanded\u00a0further protections for the institution of slavery. When the Democratic convention refused to accept these demands, the Southern delegates\u00a0walked\u00a0out.\n        An effort to reunite the party in Baltimore in June equally\u00a0failed\u00a0to find consensus producing two candidates: Stephen Douglas of Illinois and John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. The Democratic rupture\u00a0led\u00a0in large part to the election of Lincoln and\u00a0set\u00a0the stage for later Southern secession from the Union.\n        Following the collapse of the Whig Party in 1854 and the Democratic Party\u2019s splintering in\u00a01860, American political parties have nearly collapsed numerous times.\n        The Republican Party split in 1912 when Theodore Roosevelt led a \u201cBull Moose\u201d\u00a0insurgency\u00a0against Republican William Howard Taft; the result was the election of Democrat Woodrow Wilson.\n        The 1924 Democratic Party famously\u00a0went\u00a0through 103 ballots before agreeing on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis of West Virginia.\n        In 1968, the pro- and anti-war Vietnam War factions in the Democratic Party\u00a0ruptured\u00a0over the selection of Hubert H. Humphrey as its nominee, leading to the election of Republican Richard Nixon in the fall.\n        More recently, in the election of 2020, the dissident \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement certainly\u00a0sapped\u00a0support from the Republican Party.\n        Of course, party realignment is a tricky thing since we only come to\u00a0know\u00a0that it has happened in hindsight. While some of these disputes led to realignment, often they\u00a0only\u00a0signal a loss of power for the party in question in the next election.\n        How does today\u2019s House Republican\u00a0conference\u00a0fit these patterns of disfunction? For one, the\u00a0viciousness\u00a0of the arguments within the GOP conference and\u00a0the threats to members\u00a0reveal a party in disarray. What some have termed a \u201cRepublican civil war\u201d seems aptly put, and as with the last Civil War, the consequences for the two-party system could be equally lasting.\n        For another, this intraparty animosity may well mean that we are witnessing the GOP break up in real time. Like the Whigs parted ways over the issue of slavery, Republicans today seem divided among those who wish to govern and those who wish merely to make noise.\n        If the Republicans of today remain deadlocked, they will suffer a fate similar to that of Democrats in 1860. A failure to reach a majority consensus signals the doom of an American political party.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/opinions/republicans-party-splits-in-history-balcerski/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View\u00a0more opinion\u00a0at CNN.", "body": "      It\u2019s not the end of tipping \u2014 unfortunately.\n        Like most cities, Chicago has a much lower minimum wage for restaurant staff and other workers who receive tips \u2014 $9.48 per hour compared to $15.80 for other workers. Earlier this month, the city council voted to phase out the \u201csubminimum wage\u201d over the next five years.\n        The Wall Street Journal\u00a0described\u00a0this as Chicago\u00a0eliminating the\u00a0\u201ctips-as-wage system,\u201d which makes it sound like a ban on tipping.\u00a0Some,\u00a0like economist Steve Hanke, are framing this as a sad day for diners, based on the belief that the financial incentive of tips is the only way to manage and motivate service staff.\n        Nick Kokonas, co-founder of restaurant software company Tock, argues the same, but from a positive perspective.\n        \u201cSimply put, tips will be eliminated entirely and restaurants will eventually move to a service charge equivalent to the tips,\u201d\u00a0Kokonas wrote on Twitter\u00a0in advance of Chicago\u2019s vote, citing\u00a0some of the benefits\u00a0of this shift: equalized pay between cooks and servers, less discrimination, seasonal stability of wages.\n        All of this is misleading.\n        While I\u00a0wish this ordinance was a harbinger for the end of tipping in Chicago,\u00a0having watched this play out in my hometown of Toronto, Ontario,\u00a0where tipping still occurs at most restaurants, I think that the people predicting this are wrong.\n        Based on my experience and research, I expect Chicago will see a small handful of restaurateurs transitioning to\u00a0service fees instead of tips (and getting review-bombed by people who think the money is going to the owners).\u00a0But\u00a0the majority of restaurants will leave tipping in place over fear that the sticker shock from folding the true labor cost into the menu prices will scare off customers, and that their best servers will leave them for venues where they can make the most money.\n        Indeed, if tips are\u00a0what most people claim \u2014\u00a0a voluntary gift for good service, on top of an employee\u2019s livable wage\u00a0\u2014 this law won\u2019t change\u00a0that. What\u2019s more, the restaurant business is based on an emotional relationship with diners, who for the past century have gotten used to this system, and it\u2019s very hard to\u00a0change\u00a0it.\n        It\u2019s a shame, because tipping has\u00a0always been a scam that enables restaurants to suppress labor costs, which keeps menu prices down. This sustains the illusion of an affordable dining experience because the customer is expected to pay for the labor of service staff instead of the\u00a0employer.\n        But tips are really just a replacement\u00a0for a livable wage. If restaurants had to pay a living wage to their front-of-house staff instead of expecting diners to pay employees \u201cvoluntarily,\u201d their labor costs would rise, and prices with them.\n        Letting customers determine the earnings of a business\u2019 staff, thereby subjecting them to the whims and abuses of guests, was always an odious way to employ people.\u00a0Tipping emerged as a model for employing formerly enslaved Black workers\u00a0without having to pay them a real wage, if anything at all.\n        It can lead to\u00a0economic racial discrimination\u00a0and\u00a0suppression of wages for cooks.\u00a0It\u2019s a horrible system that most companies in North America wouldn\u2019t accept.\n        Instead, restaurants should pay a living wage (if the revenue does not cover the actual cost of labor, what kind of business is it?), raise menu prices to reflect the true cost, and engage with diners about the value of treating employees like professionals, rather than plan for them to depend on the personal charity of diners.\n        I recently went\u00a0to a hospitality conference to moderate a panel about tipping. Every owner or manager I spoke with described attracting, hiring and retaining good staff as their number one challenge.\n        In my research on innovative models in hospitality, the operators I engage with, the ones challenging industry orthodoxy in a variety of ways, are holding on to their best people. Many have done this by eliminating tips, as the non-tipping restaurants usually offer better wages and benefits. They also offer more consistent hours, an investment in employees\u2019 professional growth, and most importantly a workplace where cooks and servers are not pitted against each other due to their pay disparity.\n        These businesses have effectively strategized to attract and retain quality employees. Those workers stick around because they are service professionals who want to grow their jobs into careers while being treated with respect.\n        There are some owners who still hold on to the idea that cooks work for love of food, while servers are mercenaries, motivated only by money. Despite today\u2019s dire labor shortage, precious few restaurants seem willing to re-examine their employment model in order to address it.\n        The problem I encounter, when speaking with operators candidly, is that diners have little understanding of how tips work. I still encounter people who insist it\u2019s an acronym for\u00a0\u201cto insure prompt service.\u201d\n        There\u2019s a type of diner who enjoys the power that tipping grants them over workers, who belittles service staff and expects tipped employees to flirt with them. They are a minority. But if restaurants won\u2019t evolve because their business is catering to the worst kind of customer, they are less practitioners of providing memorable culinary experiences than they are trapped in an abusive relationship.\n        I hope that this is a real moment of truth for the hospitality leaders of\u00a0Chicago \u2014 and for other cities around the country.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/opinions/chicago-restaurant-tipping-mintz/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

View\u00a0more opinion\u00a0at CNN.", "body": "      Egypt has re-emerged as a pivotal actor in the Middle East thanks to the Israel-Gaza War. Its\u00a0revived influence\u00a0was epitomized by the\u00a0summit Cairo convened on Saturday for a number of Arab and European leaders. Although it didn\u2019t produce a unified statement from the parties, underscoring the challenges of finding common\u00a0ground, it was the crucial player in drawing top leaders together after several Arab countries refused to meet with President Joe Biden earlier in the week.\n        Egypt\u2019s importance is not just as a leader among Western-allied Arab countries, however. The country is a critical\u00a0partner\u00a0for the Biden administration on all issues related to Gaza because its control of the\u00a0Rafah crossing\u00a0\u2014 currently the only point of entry into the embattled Gaza Strip since Israel closed all crossings on its borders after Hamas\u2019 October 7 terror attack \u2014 allows Egypt to dictate and leverage the terms by which humanitarian assistance can enter the Palestinian territory.\n        It\u2019s understandable if Washington, which provides Egypt with over\u00a0$1 billion per year\u00a0in military assistance, is frustrated that Cairo isn\u2019t\u00a0allowing\u00a0American citizens and other nationals to exit Gaza\u00a0via the crossing, as Egypt has seemingly made their\u00a0departure\u00a0contingent on the entry of aid. It\u2019s also understandable if humanitarian groups are frustrated that Egypt won\u2019t open its border for a humanitarian corridor to let out hundreds of thousands of internally displaced Gazans who are trying to take refuge in the south of the Gaza Strip, which Rafah sits on, as the most intense fighting rages in the north.\n        But Egypt\u2019s positions reflect serious, and legitimate, concerns. First and foremost is the fear of a massive refugee flow if the crossing were opened. A decade after the Syrian civil war started, Egypt\u00a0claims\u00a0to host 9 million refugees from different countries, with no horizon of repatriation for most in sight. For Egypt, a deluge of Palestinian refugees would not only pose humanitarian and economic challenges \u2014 Egypt is currently experiencing a devastating\u00a0economic crisis\u00a0\u2014 but also security and\u00a0political ones.\n        Egyptian\u00a0President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, in uncharacteristically explicit remarks, on Wednesday warned that transferring Palestinians into Sinai will turn the peninsula into a launching pad for attacks against Israel, eliciting Israeli reprisals, triggering war between the two countries and upending the longest peace between Israel and any Arab country.\n        Additionally, the movement of Palestinian refugees out of Gaza would evoke memories of the mass displacement that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948. Egypt fears that such an eventuality would bring an end to any future prospect of Palestinian-Israeli peace based on a two-state solution, instead bringing a diplomatic void, and inflaming Arab public opinion.\n        This concern is so widely and deeply held in the region that, even as Palestinian civilian casualties mounted after October 7, other Arab countries supported Egypt in its vehement opposition to opening the Sinai for refugees. Indeed, after concluding a tour to several Arab capitals,\u00a0Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u00a0told Al-Arabiya TV that he heard \u201cfrom virtually every \u2026 leader that I\u2019ve talked to in the region that that idea is a nonstarter, and so we do not support it.\u201d\n        Additionally, Egypt has privately held that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is ultimately\u00a0Israel\u2019s problem, and that the latter should bear any\u00a0political or territorial costs\u00a0of its resolution. During the Trump administration, an American proposal to build infrastructure in Sinai to serve Gaza was roundly rejected by Cairo, part of Egyptian fears that a slippery slope that could draw it into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n        Egypt is also concerned that open crossing could allow in Hamas and its sympathizers. Hamas is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sisi\u2019s most serious domestic political rival. And\u00a0Egypt has faced Islamist terror in the Sinai Peninsula since the 2011 revolution that toppled the Mubarak regime.\n        For all these reasons, shortly after Hamas took over Gaza in 2007,\u00a0Egypt sealed the border. By 2018, according to Human Rights Watch, Egypt had razed the entire Sinai city of Rafah on the Egyptian side of the borders, destroying thousands of homes and displacing\u00a070,000 persons, to create a\u00a0nearly mile-wide buffer zone\u00a0to prevent the movement of weapons and terrorists in tunnels between Egypt and Gaza. To emphasize the point, Egypt even\u00a0flooded those tunnels. Two years later, in 2020, Egypt built a 20-foot\u00a0reinforced concrete wallthat reaches 16 feet below ground.\n        This wall has helped ensure the war in Gaza doesn\u2019t spill over into Egypt. Like other Middle Eastern states, however, what is happening in Gaza is having an impact within Egypt, where there is a significant reservoir of support for the Palestinians. For the first time since the Mubarak days, the Egyptian government\u00a0has organized anti-Israel protests\u00a0to\u00a0try to\u00a0come out ahead of public opinion on supporting the Palestinians and better control the demonstrations.\n        The very staunch US support for Israel, which reflects longstanding\u00a0American\u00a0policy, sharpened further by the brutal nature of Hamas terror and Biden\u2019s own convictions about it, has inevitably created additional tensions in the Arab world. The view that the US is complicit in the human suffering in Gaza is widely\u00a0held\u00a0in the Arab world,\u00a0partly\u00a0out of compassion and\u00a0partly out of\u00a0political opportunism. This, naturally, complicates Egypt\u2019s engagement with the US and helps explain why the meeting with Biden last week was canceled, after (later disproven) reports of Israeli targeting a hospital in Gaza circulated.\n        However, the delicate way the US approached the cancellation, framing it as a response to the\u00a0period of mourning announced\u00a0by the three Arab countries and expressing sympathy for the victims, helped ease pressure on Sisi, who would have been criticized by his public for appearing with the US president at such highly charged times, and was no doubt appreciated in Cairo. Subsequent US policy, focusing on\u00a0delivery of aid into Gaza\u00a0also signaled support for Egypt\u2019s position, buying some goodwill from Cairo.\n        Still, if Washington is committed to the objectives of both supporting Israel in its campaign to degrade, if not eradicate, Hamas and at the same time providing critical humanitarian support to Palestinian civilians, the US will need to coordinate with its Arab allies. For reasons of geography, history and diplomatic heft, Egypt is the linchpin.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/opinions/opinion-egypt-israel-gaza-hamas-afraid-omari-schenker/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

In Big Brother\u2019s eyes, both are threats worth eliminating, but in Orwell\u2019s estimation, they are not equal.\n        The male member of the couple is the hero of the novel. We know his full name. Winston Smith. We know that he is thirty nine years old, and a factotum in the Records department of the Ministry of Truth (where he spends his days manufacturing fake news), that he has brown eyes, bad teeth and varicose veins.\u00a0The woman presumably also has a full name, but we never learn it. She is simply Julia.\n        In fact, according to Orwell, she is not a woman but a\u00a0\u201cgirl,\u201d whom Winston estimates to be in her late 20s. (Tellingly, the reader never learns her age, only Winston\u2019s perception of it.) Her principal traits are her physicality and her voracious sexuality.\n        They both work in the Ministry of Truth, but while Winston uses his mind to rewrite history, Julia uses her hands in \u201csome mechanical job.\u201d She is uninterested in politics.\u00a0 She falls asleep when Winston attempts to share with her his revelations about the inner workings of Big Brother\u2019s regime and laughs with delight when he dismissively claims that she is \u201conly a rebel from the waist downwards.\u201d\n        While they are both caught up in the Thought Police\u2019s net, it\u2019s clear that Winston is the big fish. Julia only meets O\u2019Brien, their captor and interrogator, because Winston invites her to tag along when he pays a visit to the great man\u2019s apartment.\n        At first reading, Orwell\u2019s marginalization of Julia might seem like simply a product of its time\u00a0\u2014\u00a0yet a growing body of work, including most recently\u00a0Anna Funder\u2019s\u00a0\u201cWifedom: Mrs. Orwell\u2019s Invisible Life,\u201d\u00a0has emerged suggesting that Orwell was exceptionally misogynistic and patriarchal even by the standards of the 1940s.\n        Orwell first came under attack from second-wave feminists in the 1980s, including\u00a0Daphne Patai\u00a0and\u00a0Beatrix Campbell, who argued that his work generally ignored the position of women within society and specifically obscured the\u00a0burdens that poverty places on working-class women.\n  A spate of archival revelations\u00a0over the past few years further reinforced existing evidence that he was a philanderer who frequented prostitutes and seemingly never missed an opportunity to proposition both his wife\u2019s friends and his friends\u2019 wives.\n        So, how would the story\u00a0of \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d\u00a0have looked different had it been told by a feminist?\n        For one thing, Julia would have had a last name. Julia Worthing. She would also have a fully developed backstory.\u00a0 In Newman\u2019s novel, Julia comes from a family of bourgeois socialists who are initially in the vanguard of Big Brother\u2019s revolution.\n        Her family is first exiled and ultimately murdered when the leader, like the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin on whom he was modeled, consolidates his hold on power by eliminating his potential rivals within the party.\n        Julia\u2019s sexuality and her anti-intellectual practical-mindedness are the tools that help her survive life as an exile and an orphan. \u00a0She sleeps her way back from exile and into a good party job in London.\n        She mentally compartmentalizes the crimes that she is forced to commit to survive, and she possesses a knack for black-marketeering, which keeps her in chocolates, coffee and cigarettes.\u00a0Whereas Winston\u2019s rebellion is driven by an intellectual rejection of Big Brother, hers is ultimately propelled by love. (Crucially, not love for Winston Smith who is, at best, a minor character in Julia\u2019s story).\n        It\u2019s an ingenious conceit. At several points, I found myself asking whether this portrait of Julia could really be squared with the two-dimensional picture of her that we get in\u00a0\u201cNineteen Eighty-Four,\u201d and whether the story that Newman tells could hold simultaneously\u00a0with Orwell\u2019s narrative.\u00a0That they arguably could underscores how differently the world can look depending on your perspective.\n        Newman\u2019s attempt to turn Orwell\u2019s Oceania on its head and look at it from the perspective of a woman never granted the dignity of a last name is in many ways not dissimilar to this summer\u2019s blockbuster attempt to reclaim \u201cBarbie\u201d for feminism.\n        Like Barbie Handler, Julia Worthing is a product of the patriarchy who refuses to stay in the box and let herself be objectified and diminished. She insists on being the heroine of her own story and, in doing so, pushes Winston Smith into a life of blond fragility.\n        But if the Barbie movie largely dodged the problematic question of Barbie\u2019s hypersexualized physical appearance in favor of a focus on her intellectual awakening, Newman\u2019s Julia remains fundamentally a rebel from the waist downwards.\n        Why doesn\u2019t Julia get to be an intellectual rebel in her own right? Why must she be characterized by the traditional \u201cfeminine\u201d traits of empathy, practicality and intuition, not to mention a stereotypical physical attractiveness?\n        The women\u2019s movement has long been divided between maternalist or biological feminists who view woman as fundamentally different from men and seek to elevate and celebrate that difference, and equal rights feminists who argue that gender differences are largely societal constructs and that, but for patriarchy, empathy would not be deemed a feminine trait nor intellect a masculine one. (Others, of course, would argue that the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes.)\n        In doubling down on Orwell\u2019s depiction of Julia as a practical-minded anti-intellectual, Newman\u2019s book appears to come down firmly in the former camp.\n        One of my favorite parts of the original\u00a0\u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d\u00a0is a rare instance in which Orwell grants Julia intelligence and agency, with the narrator even conceding that, \u201cIn some ways she was far more acute than Winston.\u201d\n        This moment comes as the couple are discussing the seemingly endless war between Oceania and its rivals, when \u201cshe startle[s] him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself, \u2018just to keep people frightened\u2019. This was an idea that had literally never occurred to him.\u201d\n        Perhaps this is just evidence of Julia\u2019s feminine intuition, but it at least hints that she possesses a power of reasoning equal to if not beyond Winston\u2019s.\n        In exalting Julia\u2019s feminine practicality above Winston\u2019s idealism, Newman is arguably adhering to Orwell\u2019s original pessimistic message\u00a0about the futility of clinging to notions of intellectual freedom under absolute tyranny. But it is cold comfort to imagine that Julia might have survived by forfeiting her right to think for herself.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/opinions/george-orwell-1984-sandra-newman-julia-beers/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

General David Petraeus, one of the most prominent practitioners of warfare, and Lord Andrew Roberts, an eminent historian of war, have written a new book, \u201cConflict: The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine.\u201d\n        It\u2019s an insightful and thorough examination of key military conflicts over the past seven and a half decades.\u00a0The book was published as the conflict between Hamas and Israel entered its second week.\n        Petraeus and Roberts provided a sobering assessment of the challenge facing the Israeli military in trying to eliminate Hamas after its October 7 terrorist attack on southern Israel killed more than 1,400 people.\n        They emphasized that policymakers who do not have a good plan for the \u201cday after\u201d the fighting stops are simply seeding the ground for the next conflict, which in the case of Gaza necessitates some kind of positive vision for what the Palestinians can expect when the guns fall silent.\n        I interviewed\u00a0\u00a0Petraeus and Roberts for the Audible podcast\u00a0\u201cIn the Room With Peter Bergen.\u201d\u00a0 Our discussion was edited for length and clarity.\n  PETER BERGEN:\u00a0 How might this war unfold?\n  DAVID PETRAEUS:\u00a0Israel\u2019s big idea right now is to destroy Hamas, which means rendering the enemy incapable of accomplishing its mission without reconstitution. As a military commander, that means not just a lot of as-precise-as-possible airstrikes, but at some point, you have to go in on the ground, clear every building, every floor, every room, every basement, every tunnel \u2014 part of a very extensive tunnel system \u2014 against terrorists who know this place better than the backs of their hands, have demonstrated significant tactical creativity, and have\u00a0shown a willingness to blow themselves up to take Israeli soldiers with them.\n        And by the way, you not only have to clear every building like that, but you also must then retain each building by leaving a substantial force behind, one that\u2019s large enough that it can\u2019t be swarmed by the enemy who can then add captured soldiers as hostages to the over 200 hostages that have already been taken. And, of course, this will all be done in a densely populated area with substantial numbers of civilians\u00a0\u2014\u00a0even with hundreds of thousands of people\u00a0\u2014\u00a0leaving Gaza City and northern Gaza.\n        Andrew and I have gone back through all these conflicts that we recount from 1945 until now, and we can\u2019t envision a more challenging context for a military commander and soldiers than this one.\n        The big idea in the past was described as \u201cmowing the grass.\u201d\u00a0Hamas would do something particularly egregious. Israel would make a limited incursion \u2014 use a lot of air power, drone strikes and so forth to \u201cmow the grass\u201d to damage Hamas, its organization, and its infrastructure. And then Israelis would enjoy a few years of relative peace.\n        Clearly, that approach has been invalidated. But if you go in and say you mow the grass all the way down to the dirt \u2014 you can even pull the grass out \u2014 if you don\u2019t have an answer to the question of \u201cthen what\u201d that is reasonable and that can keep Hamas and Islamic Jihad from coming back, you\u2019ll have mowed the grass, and perhaps it doesn\u2019t grow back for a few years but eventually, it will, and the Israelis are going to be back in the situation that they were in before that horrific attack two weeks ago.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Some of the other obstacles that the Israelis will likely encounter in Gaza: Hostages, human shields, suicide bombers, improvised explosive devices, booby traps, snipers and fighters not in uniform. And Hamas has had years to prepare.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Also, a lot of civilians, in addition to hostages. It\u2019s hard to imagine anything more challenging than this, and that\u2019s especially true if there is a push to do this rapidly.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 The fight against ISIS in Mosul that began in late 2016, the second largest city in Iraq, seems like an interesting analogue to what may unfold in Gaza: Mosul was a city of two million people that ISIS took over and had plenty of time to dig in, its foot soldiers were willing to fight to the death.\n        How long did it take the Iraqi military assisted by American advisers and US airpower to remove ISIS from Mosul?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Over nine months. Longer if you just take the period of planning, the positioning of forces, and the setting of conditions for the attack, and that was with considerable American support \u2014 what we call \u201cadvise, assist, and enable,\u201d the enabling including lots of drones and precision munitions. And also,\u00a0a lot of situational awareness from American intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance platforms that we could put over the fighting.\n        We had an American officer in Iraqi command posts with Iraqi commanders, literally watching the same screen, watching our drone \u201cfeed,\u201d so that they could make decisions together. They could call on American air power, precision surface-to-surface munitions, and so forth.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 It still took nine months.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Exactly right. And by the way, Mosul\u2019s population wasn\u2019t two million at that time. Hundreds of thousands of civilians had left. It was certainly roughly the same size of Gaza, but not with the same number of high-rises that you find in Gaza.\u00a0.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Two of the Israeli goals seem incompatible \u2014 destroy Hamas completely and try and rescue the 200-plus hostages.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0\u00a0 It will be very challenging to accomplish both those objectives.\u00a0 And then beyond that,\u00a0how to administer Gaza after the conflict is over?\u00a0Not just handing out humanitarian assistance and rebuilding and reestablishing markets and schools and so forth, but also\u00a0conducting a\u00a0counterinsurgency campaign to ensure that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad can\u2019t come back. And of course,\u00a0a vision for the Palestinian people of what life can be like when Hamas is dismantled has to be part\u00a0of this effort as well.\n  A Regional Conflict?\u00a0ANDREW ROBERTS:\u00a0 It\u2019s also worth pointing out, of course, that you\u2019ve got to do all of this in a situation where you don\u2019t know what Iran will do next. You don\u2019t know what Hezbollah in southern Lebanon is going to do next.\u00a0The West Bank front could open up at any moment. A large number of Israeli reservists, 360,000, has been called up but if you\u2019re suddenly fighting on multiple fronts, that force gets dissipated.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 General Petraeus, you were CENTCOM commander. Your area of operation included all the countries around Israel with some kind of alignment with Iran, the Houthis in Yemen who are backed by Iran, Iranian-backed militias have a presence in Iraq, Syria is strongly backed by Iran, Hezbollah is effectively an arm of the Iranian government in Lebanon and Hamas itself has Iranian support. So, when you look at all that, what do you think?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 I think it is enormously challenging, and it could get worse. There could be regionalization of the war in a way that would be very, very serious.\u00a0You can assess that Hezbollah doesn\u2019t want to revisit the war it fought with Israel in 2006 and the damage and destruction inflicted on Hezbollah in the wake of their incursion into Israel. But Iran may push them that way, and so could public sentiment in the Shia areas in the south of Lebanon.\n  Hezbollah has 150,000 rockets, so they are not a little militia force.\u00a0That number of rockets could overwhelm Israel\u2019s air defense system.\u00a0But then, Israel would be compelled to respond with devastating strikes.\u00a0And Hezbollah knows that.\u00a0Hopefully, that knowledge will dissuade them from conducting substantial attacks on Israel.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0If this invasion happens, the pictures of destruction will just go on and on and on. The images are going to inflame the Arab world.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0The amount of battlefield imagery is a much more prominent element in conflict now than it was even 10, 15 years ago when I was privileged to command in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u00a0This is, of course, because of the widespread present proliferation of social media sites, some of which are really siloes for one view or another, the proliferation of smart phones, access to the internet, and social media\u00a0onto which individuals can upload videos, but that are not always obviously reporting truthfully.\u00a0It is also because of the greater presence of commercial imagery and other forms of open-source intelligence.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Would pressure on Hezbollah to mount a large-scale attack increase as weeks go on and more pictures of destruction come out of Gaza?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 It certainly could. So, the periods after Friday prayers will become more challenging in Muslim countries in the region, and also in Israel. This was often a challenge in Iraq when I was in command there: If there was some issue that arose that aroused the people, then tragically, it would often be amplified by the mullahs of different mosques in their Friday sermons and the resulting demonstrations could be very problematic.\n  Surprise attacksBERGEN:\u00a0 There are a couple of big themes in your book that I want to draw out. Robert Gates, the former US Secretary of Defense, kept a maxim in his office which said, \u201cThe easiest way to achieve complete strategic surprise is to commit an act that makes no sense or is even self-destructive.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Yet\u00a0you say, \u201csurprise attacks are surprisingly common.\u201d I found it fascinating that you found that dictatorships and terrorist groups are much more likely to launch surprise attacks because democracies must build consensus, which can take time. They can\u2019t just launch a war without the political support of their people.\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0It tends to be authoritarian or totalitarian powers that launch these surprise attacks. What we discovered, again and again, is that \u2014 and which I think, by the way, will also be the case here with the Gazan situation \u2014 is the response of the country that\u2019s been attacked is all the more outraged for having been the victim of a surprise attack. Look at America after Pearl Harbor. There was a sort of righteous fury that grabbed the nation and held it for four years until the US defeated Japan.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Same after 9/11, of course. Now, interestingly, President Joe Biden, in addition to expressing America\u2019s big idea, which is to have Israel\u2019s back absolutely, also offered a caution to the Israelis about what followed 9/11, acknowledging that we didn\u2019t get everything right, that the quest for vengeance can lead you to take actions that, in some respects, you might look back and say we\u2019d like to have a redo of this or that.\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 Well, partly, I think that\u2019s because, especially in response to surprise attacks, it\u2019s very difficult to promote a compromise solution if you\u2019ve just been attacked, let alone attacked in this medieval and sadistic way that Hamas has attacked in southern Israel. So, to get into the sort of frame of mind where you are offering something to the enemy requires an extraordinary degree of statesmanship that is often not present when you\u2019re the victim of a surprise attack.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0The 1973 Yom Kippur War, you cover in some detail in the book. What are the parallels with this war that Hamas has unleashed?\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 The Yom Kippur War started with an Arab surprise attack and ended with a catastrophe for the Arab armies, so hopefully, there are some direct parallels with history in this latest Hamas attack. The Israeli army was within sight of Damascus and was only a few days away from Cairo when peace broke out in 1973.\u00a0 So, there is a tremendous capacity in the IDF for taking the punches and returning them with vigor, which I\u2019m assuming will be the case when it comes to Hamas.\n  Securing GazaBERGEN:\u00a0 In 2005, the Israelis pulled out of Gaza, and elections were held which Hamas then won, and there have been no elections since. Israel doesn\u2019t seem to want to own the Gaza problem.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 They do not want to, and also they can\u2019t bring in the Palestinian Authority (the overarching Palestinian\u00a0entity based in Israel\u2019s West Bank) on the backs of Israeli tanks.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0\u00a0 In your book, you say that to secure any kind of area, as a rule of thumb, you need one security person per 50 inhabitants. There are some two million inhabitants of Gaza, which would suggest you need around 40,000 security personnel to secure Gaza. And if the Israelis aren\u2019t going to secure it, who is?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0You\u2019ve raised a very good point; whatever interim international authority might be established in Gaza will not just have to distribute humanitarian assistance, restore basic services, repair damaged infrastructure, reopen markets, schools, clinics and hospitals, and restore all the social services that Hamas\u2019 political wing have overseen. The interim authority is also going to have to conduct a counterinsurgency operation with a hard edge, with very good intelligence capabilities, because there will be remnants of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, and they will try to reestablish control in Gaza. That has to be prevented.\n        I don\u2019t know that 40,000 security personnel will be necessary in this particular case, but certainly, it will be a substantial force \u2013 and I would err on the side of larger rather than smaller.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Another one of the big themes that I took away from the book is, again and again, policymakers often have no real plan for the \u201cday after\u201d the fighting stops.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 There was an episode when I was a two-star general and commander of the great 101st Airborne Division in the early days of the fight to Baghdad, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, where we were ordered to take the city of Najaf, a city of about 400,000-500,000 people then,\u00a0and the holiest city in Shia Islam.\n        After several days of fighting, the enemy collapsed and melted away.\u00a0 We took control of the city, and I go\u00a0on the radio. I called my boss and\u00a0 said, \u201cHey, boss, I\u2019ve got good news and bad news. The good news is that we own Najaf.\u201d\n        He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the bad news?\u201d\n        I replied, \u201cWe own Najaf. What do you want us to do with it?\u201d\n        And so, I hope that some weeks, months down the road, there\u2019s not a call that\u2019s made, \u201cHey, boss, I got good news and bad news. We own Gaza City or all of Gaza. What do you want us to do with it?\u201d\n        There\u00a0has\u00a0to be a viable plan for the day after.\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 The Malayan Emergency of 1952 to \u201960 is a very good example of where the big idea was got right, not just \u201cclear and hold,\u201d but also the fact that the commander there, Sir Gerald Templer, offered the Malaysian people their independence pretty much from the beginning as they fought a communist insurgency.\n        And so that helped capture their \u201chearts and minds.\u201d That was where the original phrase came from; winning the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of the local population was essential in putting down the local communist insurgency. So, they got the population on side, which was essential, defeated the communists and independence was given in 1957.\n        I don\u2019t know how that would translate into the present Gazan situation, but there has to be something that the people on the ground can really look forward to, something positive.\n  A positive vison for the Palestinians\u00a0PETRAEUS:\u00a0There has to be a positive vision for the Palestinian people that life will be much better if Hamas is eliminated and out of their lives and that the international community will support them.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0But the Israeli government has little to no credibility with the Palestinians in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority doesn\u2019t have much credibility either because they\u2019re in the West Bank, and they\u2019re seen as almost collaborators with Israel by the folks in Gaza.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 And by the folks in the West Bank, in many cases, too.\n        It couldn\u2019t be more difficult. Andrew uses the phrase \u201cfiendishly difficult,\u201d and that is correct.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0So, if you were advising Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today from a military point of view, general, what would you advise, and Andrew, from a political point of view, what would you advise?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 Well, what\u2019s interesting is I think you must combine the two. You can\u2019t just say that you\u2019re going to destroy Hamas. You also must lay out the vision for the Palestinian people and the future of Gaza.\u00a0 And this will be challenging because there will be a vision announced, I hope, but there\u2019s also going to be a substantial loss of innocent civilian life and very substantial damage and destruction of civilian infrastructure and civilian dwellings.\n  Israel\u2019s advantagesROBERTS:\u00a0 The last chapter of our book is \u201cThe Future of War,\u201d and we look at cyber and sensors and space, AI, robotics, and also, of course, drones. And this is one area where the Israelis will have an advantage.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 Well, let\u2019s talk about some Israeli potential advantages. You mentioned robots. Also infrared and acoustic tools that might be able to look down into tunnels and armored bulldozers. What about morale? Morale is a major theme of your book. Whether it\u2019s the Ukrainians fighting the Russians or Israelis volunteering to fight today. It\u2019s a nebulous concept on some levels, but how important is it?\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 Morale is absolutely central to warfare. We came across this again and again in the course of writing this book. It\u2019s a very interesting thing when demoralization can take place and how it can take place. But if you\u2019ve got morale, it is \u201cworth several divisions,\u201d as Napoleon always used to say.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 You\u2019ve had a barbaric, horrific, unspeakable set of actions that killed some 1,400 Israelis, and to put that in perspective, from a US point of view, that\u2019s the equivalent of more than 50,000 Americans having been killed on 9/11, as opposed to the 3,000 terrible losses that we sustained. And the over 200 hostages are the equivalent of well over 6,000 Americans being taken hostage on that day. And I think we are not fully appreciating the impact of all this on the Israeli people and government.\n        The Israelis have enormous morale. When they were called up,\u00a0members of the reserves literally drove their own vehicles down to southern Israel.\u00a0And they just\u00a0parked their cars on the side of the road and\u00a0reported for duty.\n        But that also does raise yet one more challenge. The bulk of this force is reservists. They\u2019re not serving professionals or on active duty. Some will have done recent active duty or perhaps a lot of reserve duty but by no means all, and I\u2019m sure that there are those in the ranks who are a bit more advanced in age than the typical 19-year-old infantry soldier.\n        So, they\u2019ve got to be brought back in, reequipped, introduced to the more cutting-edge technology, say, night vision goggles and close combat optics on weapons that are very, very important so that you can have a precise fire, not just \u201cspray and pray.\u201d\u00a0 So, all of this has to be done as well. You have to reorganize, re-equip and retrain to some degree. At the very least, they\u2019ve got to get whatever weapon systems they have now and get reacquainted with that and do drills with their fellow soldiers as units.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 And, of course, reservists are people who\u2019ve got day jobs in the Israeli economy. If this continues for a long time, you have social, political, and economic effects inside Israel.\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0In this case, there are multiple clocks running, but one of those is the domestic economy clock, that if you call up 360,000 out of a population that\u2019s around 10 million, obviously there\u2019s an enormous impact on the economy.\n        Beyond that, the policy makers have\u00a0essentially taken the slack out of the trigger, and there will be pressure to squeeze, perhaps sooner rather than later, because of the imperative of getting on with this.\u00a0 But that should be tempered with a recognition that urban operations need to be pursued in a deliberate, methodical, careful manner.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0General Petraeus you famously said close to the beginning of the Iraq War in 2003, \u201cTell me how this ends.\u201d How does this Gaza war end?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0It depends on the conduct of the campaign. Can they fully clear, hold and then start the rebuilding?\u00a0 Are they able to identify, in particular, a true vision for the Palestinian people that is inspiring to them?\u00a0 \u201cInspiring\u201d might be a bit of a high bar, but let\u2019s use this moment as a catalyst \u2014 this horrible, despicable, unspeakable set of barbaric murders \u2014 to try to communicate a vision for the future that can\u00a0reduce\u00a0 grievances in the future, noting that nothing can conceivably justify the atrocities committed by Hamas.\n  ROBERTS:\u00a0 One thing that we can be certain of, though, in all this uncertainty is that if Israel doesn\u2019t destroy Hamas, or if it fails to, then we know how this ends, because it ends with an organization which, in the next generation, will do exactly the same thing to Israelis, will continue to kill Jews.\n  BERGEN:\u00a0 General Petraeus, you\u2019re a former director of the CIA. After October 7th, we\u2019ve heard a lot about intelligence failures. The question is, when we get further away from this, do you suspect that it will be seen as mostly a policy failure, misunderstanding Hamas\u2019\u00a0aims, having kind of a too-rosy view of Hamas and so ignoring intelligence that might have been germane?\n  PETRAEUS:\u00a0 I think this was a real intelligence failure, and I think it was also a military readiness failure. My speculation is that Hamas dramatically improved its operational security and prevented Israel from developing the understanding of the extremists\u2019 intentions well before they materialized as terrorist operations.\n        I think we\u2019ll come to understand better how creative Hamas was in using all kinds of ways to get into Israel \u2014 paragliders as well as bulldozers and golf carts. But in advance of that, they blinded the surveillance systems along the wall by taking out the communication nodes that connect those observation systems to command posts that are monitoring those systems, and so there was an overreliance on technology.

He is the author of \u201cLincoln and the Fight for Peace.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View\u00a0more opinion\u00a0at CNN.", "body": "      Threats begin when reason fails.\n        The failed full-court press to install Republican Rep. Jim Jordan as House Speaker revealed ugly examples of how violent threats are becoming normalized inside Trump\u2019s GOP.\n        After Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa switched her vote on Wednesday to oppose Jordan, she issued a statement saying she received \u201ccredible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls.\u201d\n        Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado told NBC that he\u2019d received death threats as well.\u00a0 According to Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas, the strategy behind the threats is to \u201cAttack, attack, attack. Attack the members who don\u2019t agree with you, attack them, beat them into submission.\u201d\n        This is the opposite of anything resembling deliberative democracy or politics in a civil society.\u00a0(Jim Jordan, who dropped out of the race for speaker on Friday after a secret ballot found he had lost the support of his fellow Republicans as the party\u2019s choice, condemned the death threats, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong.\u201d)\n  One voicemail in particular, left for the wife of an unnamed conservative congressman \u2014\u00a0played exclusively on our colleague Jake Tapper\u2019s show \u2014 offers a portrait of the pathology that has driven the GOP into this ditch.\n        The caller, an aggrieved man, lets loose in a tirade that needs a close reading.\n        The unhinged caller begins with a lot of furious cursing and standard dehumanization \u2014\u00a0describing the anonymous congressman as a \u201cpig\u201d because he publicly opposed Jordan. The voicemail continues, with the caller suggesting that the principled decision was due to the influence of the \u201cdeep state.\u201d This is a tell that the caller has been drinking from the right-wing media well.\n        But that\u2019s basic compared to his threats to \u201ccome follow you all over the place.\u00a0We\u2019re going to be up your ass. F\u2013\u2013king nonstop. We are now Antifa. We\u2019re going to do what the left does.\u201d\n        This is a small masterpiece of projection \u2014 one that we\u2019ve seen before in the right\u2019s baseless claims that the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol was not the work of conservative Trump supporters, but members of the leftist group Antifa.\u00a0In the run-up to that attack, members of the Proud Boys even bragged that they could dress up as Antifa.\n        The bogeyman that is the fear of Antifa has become mainstream, with conservatives often\u00a0invoking the group\u00a0or other figures they associate with the left as a scapegoat for\u00a0or distraction from\u00a0violent actions on the right\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a tactic sometimes called \u201caggressive defensiveness.\u201d\n        It\u2019s not the only illogical mind-bender. The caller repeatedly uses an anti-gay slur to describe the congressman to his (*checks notes*)\u00a0wife, reflecting the insecure mindset that masquerades as being uber macho, accusing those who are more left-leaning as being gay and therefore weak in that twisted worldview.\n        That\u2019s not all. The fanatic threatening violence also accuses the congressman of being a \u201cwarmongering piece of s\u2013-t\u201d\u2014\u00a0perhaps reflecting the post-Trump isolationist impulses on the far-right. In the next breath, however, he says that the war in Israel creates moral urgency to push through a Jim Jordan speakership.\n        Then comes the threat of doxxing. The caller says that he and unnamed others are uploading the wife\u2019s personal contact information to the internet to guarantee more harassment. This is a fear-based play from a crank who wants to seem like a member of the majority by intimidating people he disagrees with.\n        Any sense that this was a random unhinged person without a partisan political agenda was demolished by his demand that the congressman vote for \u201cJim Jordan or more conservative.\u201d This caller has explicit right-wing ideological demands.\n        If the wife doesn\u2019t succeed in switching the congressman\u2019s vote, he promises that \u201cyou\u2019re going to be f\u2013-king molested like you can\u2019t ever imagine.\u201d\n        Molested. As in sexually assaulted. And then, after a beat in which you can practically hear the gears turning in his head, the caller says, \u201cAnd again, non-violently.\u201d\u00a0This is a cynical move of the kind that allows January 6th\u00a0apologists to point to Trump saying the armed crowd should march on the capitol \u201cpeacefully.\u201d\u00a0It is a legalistic non-sequitur designed to distract from obvious intent.\n        The reason I\u2019ve run through all the elements of this threat-scape is because it reflects live-wire associations from the far-right media ecosystem. The disparate threads are all there, with the intent of intimidating people to do their will\u00a0\u2014\u00a0turning over more power to the far-right.\n        It didn\u2019t work this time. But it has in the past. After the attack on the Capitol, a Republican member of Congress told a colleague he was afraid to vote to certify the election, despite his personal, fact-based belief that Biden\u2019s win was legitimate, because he was afraid for the safety of his family.\n        Similar fears drove Republicans to not vote their conscience in Trump\u2019s second impeachment. As former Congresswoman Liz Cheney told CNN, \u201cIf you look at the vote to impeach, for example, there were members who told me that they were afraid for their own security \u2014 afraid, in some instances, for their lives.\u201d\n        So while it\u2019s notable that this effort to strongarm support for Jim Jordan failed, the attempt to normalize threats of violence are still ongoing. Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who\u00a0the House select committee on January 6 found\u00a0sent text messages confirming his involvement in the plot to overturn the 2020 election results, dismissed the death threats as being a \u201cred herring.\u201d      Jake Sherman, founder of Punchbowl News, reported that Jordan ally Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio said behind closed doors that it wasn\u2019t Jordan\u2019s fault that members of Congress were getting death threats; they had brought it upon themselves by opposing him.\n        This is the politics that Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric\u00a0has wrought\u00a0among his supporters in\u00a0the Republican Party. It reflects the furious worldview that right-wing media sells to keep its listeners addicted to the anger and anxiety, turning much of the GOP into what Utah Sen. Mitt Romney calls \u201ca pro-authoritarian party.\u201d\n        These threats of violence often use fear, promising elected officials not just physical harm, but the loss of power, reinforced by the secondary threat that they will lose their partisan primaries if they don\u2019t bow to the base.\n        This is unsustainable. But coming forward and refusing to be intimidated is a step toward breaking this hyper-partisan fever. It is a hopeful sign that Jordan couldn\u2019t ultimately win even a majority of the Republican caucus when it was put to a secret ballot. Bullies only respect strength\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and threats are really admissions of weakness, if they are called out with the confidence that comes from moral clarity and a determination to defend our democracy.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/21/opinions/violent-threats-tell-us-about-the-gop-avlon/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest\u00a0opinion takes\u00a0of the week from CNN and other outlets.", "body": "      It was the speech President Franklin D. Roosevelt never gave. In a radio address scheduled for April 13, 1945, the fourth-term president would have said, \u201cIf civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships \u2014 the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together and work together, in the same world, at peace.\u201d\n        But the day before, Roosevelt was sitting for a portrait at his cottage in Warm Springs, Georgia, when he suddenly slumped in his chair, the victim of a stroke. He didn\u2019t live to see the allies\u2019 victory in World War II that year or the conference in San Francisco that month that established the United Nations.\n        Roosevelt originally conceived of the UN as a muscular force to keep the peace, with the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom and China acting as \u201cfour policemen\u201d to rein in nations that would otherwise go to war. He wanted, in the words of the undelivered April 13 speech, \u201can end, forever, to this impractical, unrealistic settlement of the differences between governments by the mass killing of peoples.\u201d\n        The world in 2023 is a much different place, but peace, as Roosevelt envisioned it, remains elusive. A two-week-old conflict in the Middle East has already claimed thousands of lives against the backdrop of a multipolar web of alliances and rivalries in which the world\u2019s major powers often lack the ability to restrain conflict, and sometimes even encourage it.\n        On Thursday evening, though, President Joe Biden, who was a toddler when FDR died, sounded a Rooseveltian tone in asserting that the US still bears a special responsibility for seeking to promote world peace. He proposed billions in new aid to both Ukraine and Israel.\n        \u201cWe\u2019re facing an inflection point in history \u2014 one of the moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come,\u201d Biden argued. \u201cAmerican leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us, America, safe.\u201d\n        Biden spoke just after returning from a trip to Israel to demonstrate support for an ally mourning the loss of more than 1,400 people in the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack. But his diplomatic efforts to meet with Arab leaders came undone after a devastating explosion at a hospital in Gaza. While Israel released evidence that the blast resulted from a rocket misfired by militants in Gaza and US officials signaled agreement, that did not tame the fury of the Palestinians and their supporters in the region.\n        What\u2019s next?\n  Seth Moulton, a Marine Corps veteran and a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, says there are urgent lessons from America\u2019s 2003 war in Iraq.\n        \u201cIsrael is about to start an invasion of Gaza with the same mission we had in those early days in Iraq: defeat the enemy, or in Netanyahu\u2019s words,\u00a0\u2018crush and eliminate\u2019 Hamas.\u201d\n        \u201cBut the lesson America quickly learned in Iraq and Afghanistan was that you have to have a plan for the day after. Outside the southern Iraqi city of Najaf during the invasion, then Colonel David Petraeus famously asked,\u00a0\u2018Tell me how this ends\u2026.\u2019\u201d\n        \u201cThe next year, I found myself in that same city Petraeus had conquered, trying to win it back. It was my second of what would become four tours in Iraq, facing far worse combat than we saw during the invasion.\u201d\n        The origins of the two wars are very different, Moulton pointed out, but there is the commonality that in a war with insurgents, some tactics can backfire.\n        \u201cNobody wants to see five-year-old Palestinian kids killed in the crossfire with Hamas, especially if their deaths only recruit more terrorists.\u201d\n        \u201cAnd nobody wants to see five-year-old Israeli kids dying, in the same forever war, 20 years from today.\u201d\n        Israeli analyst Shmuel Rosner observed that \u201cIsrael says its goal is toppling Hamas, and Biden is no doubt asking: What comes later? Biden himself initially\u00a0supported the US 2003 war in Iraq\u00a0only to end up as the president who ordered the US pullout of Afghanistan. In the 20 years in between, he witnessed the two countries that the US invaded struggle to transform their leadership from one government to another. He is familiar with the cost involved, the chaos, the bloodshed\u2026 he surely wants to see a convincing answer to the question of the day after.\u201d\n        Biden\u2019s trip to Israel and Oval Office speech \u201cshow\u00a0a confident, experienced commander-in-chief projecting gravitas and a deep knowledge of history,\u201d according to David Mark. \u201cBiden\u2019s efforts stand out even more than usual since his likely 2024 Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has been clumsy and ineffective in trying to insert himself into these news events, as when he\u00a0praised Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terror group\u00a0based in Lebanon, in the wake of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel. At the same time, the Republicans in office are in disarray as an increasingly embarrassing Republican leadership struggle in the House has paralyzed Capitol Hill.\u201d\n  Hani Almadhoun, who grew up in the Gaza Strip, now lives in the US and works as director of philanthropy at the\u00a0United Nations Relief and Works Agency USA.\u00a0\u201cIn the northern reaches of Gaza,\u201d he wrote, \u201cover 20 members of my extended family seek shelter under the refuge of a staircase\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a frail shield against the relentless and merciless storm of airstrikes.\u201d\n        \u201cThey tread cautiously, avoiding windows and the desolate streets where the overwhelming stench of death, fire and chaos hangs heavy in the air\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cThe negative impact of this war on my family in Gaza is hard to overstate: hospitals running out of space for the dead and injured, pushing the local hospitals to\u00a0use ice cream trucks to preserve the bodies.\u201d\n  Yasmine Mohammed, whose father was born and raised in Gaza, observed that \u201csince Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel, as I have read post after post on social media referring to Hamas as\u00a0freedom fighters\u00a0involved in anti-colonial resistance, I have been struck by the devastating weight of this lie. It is an insult to Palestinians to refer to these terrorists as our freedom fighters.\u201d\n        \u201cAt the hands of Hamas, the\u00a0Jewish people\u00a0have endured horrors\u00a0not seen since the Holocaust. And, like the Nazis, Hamas does not view Jewish people as human beings. According to\u00a0its 1988 covenant, every Jew must be eradicated from this earth.\u00a0Its goal is not the genocide of Jewish people in Israel; its goal is the genocide of all Jewish people on this planet, period\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cHamas is not Gaza, and Gaza is not Hamas. Gaza is an area of land with people who are trying to do the best that they can to survive under abysmal circumstances. Gazans are just human beings, like their Israeli neighbors. They want to live in a peaceful environment where they do not have to be concerned about the safety of their children.\u201d\n        When comedian Pete Davidson was 7, his father, a New York City firefighter, died responding to the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. As Dean Obeidallah noted, that gave Davidson\u2019s cold open on last week\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d a haunting resonance.\n  \u201cIn a time when social media is filled with people saying they stand with one side or the other, Davidson instead made a plea to stand for humanity,\u201d Obeidallah observed.\n        Davidson said, \u201cI saw so many terrible pictures this week of children suffering \u2014 Israeli children and Palestinian children \u2014 and it took me back to a really horrible, horrible place.\u201d He added, \u201cNo one in this world deserves to suffer like that, especially not kids.\u201d\n        Wadea Al-Fayoume,\u00a0a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy was stabbed to death last weekend outside Chicago by his family\u2019s landlord, \u201da 71-year-old man who\u2019s been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other crimes,\u201d wrote Khaled A. Beydoun. \u201cThe attacker also stabbed Wadea\u2019s mother more than a dozen times. She\u00a0lived. But what does that word even mean anymore?\u2026 What does \u2018living\u2019 mean for\u00a0millions of Arabs and Muslims who call the United States home, burdened with the impossible task of proving their allegiance, over and over again, in response to bellowing demands that bury our humanity?\u201d\n        \u201cIt feels like we are living on borrowed time, like we were extended a contingent citizenship that can be stripped at any time, on account of events that unfold in America or on the other side of the world.\u201d\n        For more:\n  Mukesh Kapila: War didn\u2019t look like this when the Geneva Conventions were writtenFrida Ghitis: Zelensky\u2019s inescapable new realityNicole Hemmer: Why student protests against Israel are so painful, polarizing and complicatedKobi Michael, a longtime intelligence and security analyst for Israel, told Peter Bergen that Hamas used \u201cmore than 2,000 terrorists from the special unit of Hamas, the\u00a0Nukhba,\u201d \u2014or more than half the unit\u2019s total manpower \u2014 to carry out its attack on southern Israel.\n        \u201cWhat was the strategic aim of such an operation, considering that they knew for sure that the price tag would be very high and they were endangering their very existence? I\u2019m sure that Hamas was sure that the shock and horror of this operation and the casualties that they would cause would be interpreted by all the Palestinians, that this was a sign from God that this was the time to open all the battlefronts and to fight Israel and this will be the end of the state of Israel. They were sure about it.\u201d\n        Bergen wrote that \u201cKhaled Hroub,\u00a0a\u00a0Palestinian academic and the author of \u2018Hamas: A Beginner\u2019s Guide,\u2019\u00a0says he believes that Hamas did not expect that the October 7 attack on Israel would be the scale that it became, and the\u00a0group didn\u2019t have a plan\u00a0for what came afterward.\u201d\n        Neither Israel nor Hamas have \u201ca very clear plan for what happens down the road,\u201d Hroub said. \u201cEven if the Israeli military succeeded in destroying Hamas, the question facing everyone is, what\u2019s next?\u201d\n        The election of Jim Jordan as House speaker seemed \u201cto make perfect sense in the era of Trump,\u201d wrote Julian Zelizer.\n        \u201cJordan is as MAGA as they come. Indeed, he was doing MAGA along with the\u00a0Tea Party long before Trump\u00a0came to town. He has been a\u00a0staunch opponent of reproductive rights, a fervent\u00a0believer in radical deregulation, a\u00a0climate change denier, a culture wars soldier and anything-goes politician who believes government shutdowns are just part of the normal price of business.\u201d\n        Yet through three embarrassing ballots on the House floor, and after his allies in the party and the conservative media tried to squeeze the anti-Jordan members to flip in his favor, Jordan failed to gain the 217 Republican votes needed to win the post. On Friday afternoon, he lost another vote \u2014 a secret ballot among his GOP colleagues to remain the party\u2019s nominee for speaker \u2014 and was essentially forced to drop out.\n  \u201cThe question is what has gone wrong? Intimidation, bullying and political pressure certainly can work,\u201d Zelizer noted. \u201cJust look at the Republican who is by far and away the\u00a0leading contender\u00a0in the race to become the nominee for his party in 2024, former President Donald Trump.\u201d\n        \u201cIt is not a mystery that Trump has built an entire career on the power of intimidation. If you are against him, he will put all his effort in destroying you. If you stand in his way, he rallies his supporters to make it clear that you will not survive being his opponent.\u201d\n  John Avlon pointed to the intimidation tactics used against Republican legislators who refused to vote for Jordan, including an expletive-filled voicemail left for the wife of one congressman, which CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper played on air. \u201cThis is the politics that Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric has wrought among his supporters in the Republican Party,\u201d wrote Avlon. \u201cIt reflects the furious worldview that right wing media sells to keep its listeners addicted to the anger and anxiety, turning much of the GOP into what Utah Sen. Mitt Romney calls \u2018a pro-authoritarian party.\u2019\u201d\n  SE Cupp said, \u201cRepublicans are squarely to blame for where they are today, more interested in punishing each other than they are in governing or solving problems. But, what if Democrats somewhere down the line are given an opportunity to step in and restore some functionality to the House?\u201d They should take it, Cupp argued.\n        \u201cThe American people aren\u2019t stupid \u2014 they can see the mess Republicans have created for themselves. But at the end of the day, they\u2019ll grow tired of intransigence and dysfunction in Congress. And eventually, Democrats will get the blame for that, too.\u201d\n        Sidney Powell drew fame in the closing days of the Trump administration for her bizarre election-denier claims and her threat to \u201crelease the Kraken.\u201d      She never unveiled the promised evidence of fraud in the 2020 election and was instead criminally charged in Fulton County, Georgia, along with Trump and 17 other co-defendants for their alleged attempts to overturn the state\u2019s 2020 election results. On Thursday, Powell \u201creleased\u00a0herself from the case by\u00a0pleading guilty\u00a0to six misdemeanor offenses and agreeing to testify truthfully against her codefendants as part of her plea deal,\u201d wrote legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers.\n        \u201cPowell\u2019s testimony is hugely important and her plea is a big breakthrough for prosecutors. She is the first cooperating witness who was part of the limited group that met with Trump to craft the plans to overthrow the election. She was also present at an\u00a0infamous meeting\u00a0at the White House on December 18, 2020 that devolved into a screaming match.\u201d\n        A day after Powell\u2019s plea, attorney Kenneth Chesebro pleaded guilty to a felony charge of conspiracy, admitting that he took part in a scheme to create a slate of fake pro-Trump electors with Trump, Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman.\n        On Monday, the former president had suffered another setback when the judge hearing the federal election interference case imposed a \u201cgag order\u00a0on Trump, limiting his ability to publicly attack special counsel Jack Smith, Smith\u2019s staff, court personnel and potential witnesses in the case related to Trump\u2019s alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election,\u201d wrote Jill Filipovic. \u201cIt\u2019s not a muzzle of Trump\u2019s ability to speak in general, but it is a demand that he not smear those involved in the case against him\u2026\u201d\n        \u201cThe decision to gag a defendant should not be taken lightly, nor infused with politics. It is crucial that Trump, as odious and dangerous as I personally find him, have the ability to fully campaign: to criticize his opponent, to criticize the system and to make the case for putting him back in the White House. Principles like the importance of free speech cannot bow to political preferences.\u201d\n        \u201cBut freedom has never existed without any limitation.\u201d\n  David Goldblatt: The people Olympic host cities don\u2019t want you to seeAmy Bass: What Mary Lou Retton will always mean to usAmy Klein: Why \u2018Old Dads\u2019 made me so madJudge Glock: The perfect storm hitting homebuyersHolly Thomas: Bearing the weight of all our hopes, the \u2018Frasier\u2019 revival never stood a chanceRichie Hofmann: The poet who found truth in death, seasons, teaching and even \u2018Schitt\u2019s Creek\u2019AND\u2026      De Niro. DiCaprio. Scorsese.\n        Could the Hollywood icons who collaborated on the new movie, \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d possibly match the high drama of David Grann\u2019s 2017 book by that name?\n        It chronicled the White settlers who murdered and stole from members of the oil-rich Osage tribe in Oklahoma in the 1920s and the excruciating effort to achieve a bit of justice. \u201cTo convey that gravitas,\u201d wrote Noah Berlatsky, \u201cMartin Scorsese has very self-consciously made an Important Movie. Leonardo\u00a0DiCaprio\u00a0and Robert De Niro give big, Oscar-eyeing performances. And the runtime is 3 hours and 26 minutes\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a marathon apparently designed to bludgeon viewers into submission with meaning.\u201d\n  \u201cThe heavy-handed approach, unfortunately, tends to squeeze a lot of the nuance and insight out of its source material\u2026\u201d      \u201cDiCaprio\u2019s performance is all sideways looks and shuffling evasion, with moments of dashing charm. It\u2019s very well done, and, again, well-designed to wow the Oscar committee,\u201d noted Berlatsky.\n        \u201cBut should a movie about systemic racist violence really be focused on the Oscar-turn of the White villain?

(On Friday, the judge\u00a0put a temporary hold on this gag order to give the defense and prosecution more time to brief her on the issue after Trump appealed the order.)\n        Later in the week, there were potentially significant developments in Trump\u2019s criminal case in Fulton County, Georgia, where he\u2019s charged with 13 felonies\u00a0over alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election in that state.\u00a0Two of Trump\u2019s co-defendants\u00a0in that case \u2014\u00a0Sidney Powell\u00a0and\u00a0Kenneth Chesebro\u00a0\u2014 pleaded guilty to various charges and pledged to testify for the prosecution in future cases, which could include Trump\u2019s.\n        (Trump has denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to\u00a0state\u00a0and\u00a0federal\u00a0charges stemming from attempts to overturn the 2020 election.)\n        But the case that may pose the greatest threat to Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2024 is not one of his criminal cases. Rather, it\u2019s a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0in Colorado that not only saw some bad news for Trump last week but also is scheduled to start trial this month.\n        This\u00a0case\u00a0involves a lawsuit initiated by\u00a0a liberal watchdog group\u00a0on behalf of six Colorado voters to disqualify Trump from holding office by way of\u00a0Section 3 of the 14th Amendment\u00a0over his role in events leading to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n        It seeks to block him from the 2024 primary ballot in Colorado over the amendment\u2019s provision disqualifying from future office\u00a0US officials who have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution if they have \u201cengaged in insurrection\u201d and/or \u201cgiven aid or comfort\u201d to insurrectionists.\n        On Friday,\u00a0 Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace\u00a0rejected\u00a0three arguments by Trump and the Colorado GOP to dismiss the case before the scheduled October 30 trial date. One of the most powerful points the judge made was rebuffing the argument that state officials have no discretion over who is placed on the ballot if a political party wants that person listed.\n  In her ruling, Wallace wrote, \u201cIf the Party, without any oversight, can choose its preferred candidate, then it could theoretically nominate anyone regardless of their age, citizenship, residency.\u201d She added, \u201cSuch an interpretation is absurd; the Constitution and its requirements for eligibility are not suggestions, left to the political parties to determine at their sole discretion.\u201d\n        And Wallace \u2014 to the likely chagrin of Trump \u2014 cited in support of this point a\u00a02012 opinion\u00a0from Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, when he was a federal appellate judge. In that case, Gorsuch\u00a0wrote\u00a0that states do have the legal authority to \u201cexclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office.\u201d\n        Wallace did not, however,\u00a0conclude that \u201cthe Fourteenth Amendment can be used to exclude a presidential candidate from the primary ballot, or that the Secretary of State is empowered to evaluate such a question.\u201d Those issues \u2014 and others \u2014 are to be decided in the upcoming trial.\n        But this suit \u2014 if successful \u2014 could be more of a threat to Trump\u2019s candidacy than his criminal cases. Why? Trump could be convicted in any of his criminal cases, yet there\u00a0is no constitutional prohibition\u00a0that bars him from running for president. In fact, Trump\u00a0could be in prison\u00a0and still run.\n        However, if Trump loses this case over the 14th\u00a0Amendment \u2014 or any of the similar ones in states such as\u00a0Michigan and\u00a0Minnesota\u00a0\u2014 his name would not appear on the ballot in those states since he would be deemed constitutionally disqualified to be a candidate for president.\n        Trump still has a motion pending to throw out the Colorado lawsuit, and his\u00a0campaign has criticized\u00a0the Colorado judge\u2019s rulings.\u00a0\u201cShe is going against the clear weight of legal authority. We are confident the rule of law will prevail, and this decision will be reversed \u2014 whether at the Colorado Supreme Court, or at the US Supreme Court,\u201d a Trump campaign spokesperson said. \u201cTo keep the leading candidate for President of the United States off the ballot is simply wrong and un-American.\u201d\n        But regardless of the decision in Colorado, even\u00a0legal scholars\u00a0who have opined that Trump violated Section 3 of the 14th\u00a0Amendment have acknowledged that ultimately this issue must go to the US Supreme Court for a final decision. And that is the way it should be given the importance of this issue. But the Colorado case could be the one that makes it to our nation\u2019s highest court.\n        To those who dismiss the prospect of Trump being disqualified from the ballot, check out the case of former New Mexico elected official\u00a0Couy Griffin, who had been the head of a group called Cowboys for Trump.\n        A lawsuit was brought against Griffin alleging he violated Section 3 of the 14th\u00a0Amendment over his actions in connection with the January 6 attack. After a trial was held, the judge concluded \u2014 based on expert testimony \u2014 that the January 6 event was an \u201cinsurrection\u201d as\u00a0contemplated by the 14th Amendment, which\u00a0was ratified in 1868\u00a0after the Civil War.\u00a0Section 3 of the 14th Amendment\u00a0was intended to keep former Confederates from holding office after the war.\n        In 2022,\u00a0Griffin was found guilty\u00a0of a misdemeanor of trespassing on US Capitol grounds but was acquitted\u00a0of a second misdemeanor charge of disorderly and disruptive conduct.\n        The judge\u00a0deemed\u00a0Griffin to have \u201cengaged in\u201d the insurrection by his conduct of being on the Capitol grounds. As the judge\u00a0explained, \u201cOne need not personally commit acts of violence to \u2018engag[e] in\u2019 insurrection. \u2026 Engagement thus can include non-violent overt acts or words in furtherance of the insurrection.\u201d\n        Consequently, Griffin was removed from office as a commissioner\u00a0in Otero County\u00a0and barred from being on the ballot in the future in New Mexico. The September 2022 ruling marked the first time an elected official had been removed from office for participation or support of the Capitol riot. The state\u2019s Supreme Court\u00a0rejected\u00a0Griffin\u2019s final appeal to overturn the decision earlier this year.\n        To those who think it\u2019s undemocratic to ban officials from the ballot if they are found to have violated the 14th Amendment, I have two responses. First, it\u2019s far more undemocratic to \u201cengage in\u201d an insurrection designed to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. And second, we can\u2019t ignore the conditions clearly imposed on candidates set forth in the US Constitution. At least, not if we want to remain a democratic republic.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/opinions/trump-colorado-ballot-lawsuit-14th-amendment-obeidallah/index.html", "section": "opinions"}
{"title": "      Opinion: Scorsese\u2019s \u2018Killers of the Flower Moon\u2019 does a disservice to its source material\n    ", "author": "", "published_on": "  Updated\n        10:39 AM EDT, Mon October 23, 2023\n    ", "abstract": "  Editor\u2019s Note: Noah Berlatsky (@nberlat) is a freelance writer in Chicago. The views expressed here are his own. View\u00a0more opinion\u00a0articles on CNN.", "body": "      \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d\u00a0is about an important topic: a series of horrific murders in the Osage Nation in the 1920s. To convey that gravitas, Martin Scorsese has very self-consciously made an Important Movie. Leonardo\u00a0DiCaprio\u00a0and Robert De Niro give big, Oscar-eyeing performances. And the runtime is 3 hours and 26 minutes\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a marathon apparently designed to bludgeon viewers into submission with meaning.\n        The heavy-handed approach, unfortunately, tends to squeeze a lot of the nuance and insight out of its source material. David Grann\u2019s thoughtful, painful nonfiction account, which inspired the film, is much more humble in ambition. But for that very reason, it leaves space for a less familiar, and less comforting story about collective, rather than individual;\u00a0evil;\u00a0and the petty hatreds, small as life, which enable the accumulation of death.\n  A finalist for the National Book Award, Grann\u2019s 2017 book is structured more or less as a detective story. The Osage\u00a0tribe were forced off lands in the Ohio and Mississippi River\u00a0valleys and settled in supposedly worthless land in Oklahoma. When they discover oil there, however, the Osage people become wealthy.\u00a0That sets the stage for unscrupulous locals to target\u00a0many of\u00a0them for their share of the oil wealth, or \u201chead rights.\u201d Tom White, an agent in the nascent FBI, comes from Washington to investigate deaths that seem to center around the family of\u00a0Mollie Burkhart. His investigation specifically leads him to\u00a0Mollie\u2019s husband, Ernest, and Ernest\u2019s uncle, William King Hale, a wealthy community leader and philanthropist.\n        If that was all there was to the story, it would fit into Hollywood White savior narratives fairly easily, with Tom White as the hero bringing villainous gangsters to justice. But Grann,\u00a0a staff writer for The New Yorker,\u00a0very deliberately\u00a0avoids that route. Instead, the conclusion of his book presents evidence that Hale was far from alone.\n        Because of racism, the Osage were deemed legally incompetent to\u00a0handle their own affairs, and forced to get\u00a0their\u00a0money only through designated local White\u00a0guardians. Osage people also had little recourse in the racist court system. This created huge incentives for graft and even for murder.\n        Hale and\u00a0Burkhart were caught and sent to prison for a time. But Grann doesn\u2019t believe they were the only killers. Instead, White people cultivated what Grann calls \u201ca culture of murder\u201d involving doctors, judges, sheriffs\u00a0and virtually everyone at the state level and beyond. Ultimately, various federal officials and Tom White himself were complicit in a system which incentivized the dispossession and brutalization of Osage people, whose wealth was seen as an unacceptable affront by White society.\n        Grann\u2019s book, with its reliance on a detective genre of singular culprits and courtroom justice, is insufficient to encompass the crime against the Osage.\u00a0Grann can try to trace the outlines of injustice, but his pages are too small to contain it, or even describe it fully.\n        Scorsese doesn\u2019t totally abandon those insights. He shows how being forced to go through\u00a0White guardians to access their money humiliates the Osage and makes them vulnerable. He adds a coda which acknowledges that not every villain in the piece is brought to justice. But he doesn\u2019t really follow up on those threads, or use them to acknowledge the limitations of his own project.\n        Instead, he defaults to\u00a0that standard Scorsese genre, the gangster picture. Having cast De Niro as Hale and DiCaprio as\u00a0Burkhart, the director has committed himself to focusing on the bad guys. And so he does. We\u2019re treated to a lot of De Niro uttering good-natured slick threats as he did in Scorsese\u2019s \u201cGoodfellas.\u201d There\u2019s also a scene with a paddle that more or less consciously evokes one of De Niro\u2019s more famous set pieces with a baseball bat in \u201cThe Untouchables.\u201d (This sequence is very much not in the book.)\n  DiCaprio gets the most screentime in a role that again has precedent in Scorsese\u2019s oeuvre. He\u2019s the conflicted antihero who is maybe little more than a villain, in the tradition of DeNiro in \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and \u201cRaging Bull\u201d\u00a0or Ray Liotta in \u201cGoodfellas.\u201d Film\u00a0Burkhart \u00a0truly does love his wife; his relationship with\u00a0Mollie (Lily Gladstone) is sweetly romantic and also corrupted by greed and abuse in ways that\u00a0Burkhart isn\u2019t willing to admit even to himself. DiCaprio\u2019s performance is all sideways looks and shuffling evasion, with moments of dashing charm. It\u2019s very well done, and, again, well-designed to wow the Oscar committee.\n        But should a movie about systemic racist violence really be focused on the Oscar-turn of the White villain? Scorsese has repeatedly, and with some justice, lambasted the sameness of blockbuster superhero films. But \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d reveals that Scorsese\u2019s narrative, genre-anchored, humanist approach to big, important filmmaking has serious limitations as well.\n        There are\u00a0films that\u00a0deal thoughtfully with genocide and structural violence:\u00a0For example,\u00a0Joshua Oppenheimer\u2019s \u201cThe Act of Killing,\u201d Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski\u2019s \u201cIda,\u201d Alain Resnais\u2019 \u201cNight and Fog.\u201d Those are all films which resolutely avoid pulp gestures, celebrity turns, and easy questions about the origin of evil, much less easy answers. In contrast, Scorsese\u2019s focus on individual character and internal moral struggle is ill-suited to a story about White supremacy and the way in which individual evil is a collective endeavor\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a\u00a0structure of permission, hate, envy and discrimination which is so horrible in part because it\u2019s so\u00a0undramatic. Ernest\u00a0Burkhart isn\u2019t a fascinating conflicted villain; he\u2019s just another White guy whose entire community agrees that he\u2019s entitled to take what he wants from people who aren\u2019t White.\n        Grann understood that. He doesn\u2019t spend much time speculating in his book about\u00a0Burkhart\u2019s \u00a0motives or\u00a0Burkhart\u2019s soul.\u00a0Scorsese, though, wants a sweeping epic; he wants drama, deep character development, profound human insight. \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d has all the expected hallmarks of a quality Scorsese film. It\u2019s complete; it\u2019s controlled. Which is why, perhaps, it feels like it doesn\u2019t do justice to the Osage\u2019s story,\u00a0which, as Grann realizes, is defined by absences, erasures and narratives that can never be told now, no matter how long you make a movie\u2019s run time.\n  Correction: This essay has been updated to correct that the Osage people became wealthy through their discovery of oil in Oklahoma.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/opinions/killers-of-the-flower-moon-scorsese-morality-berlatsky/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

My taste in books runs a fairly wide gamut with few exceptions, one of them being mysteries. So, I was quite surprised to find myself immersed in\u00a0Louise Penny\u2019s Inspector Gamache novels, all 18 of them.\n        After I received a diagnosis for breast cancer in December of 2022, Peter, one of my closest friends, told me to read Penny\u2019s books. He assured me that the books would transport me to a different world, Three Pines, and that I would find the main character, Inspector Gamache, fascinating.\n        With my surgery scheduled for late December, I began the search to find the books in the used section of my local bookstore. I found comfort in seeing the pile of books on my nightstand grow as I successfully hunted them down. Knowing that I would not run out of books, no matter how many sleepless nights I might be facing, calmed me.\n        Peter was right. I fell into the trance of Three Pines; the aroma of the croissants, the caf\u00e9 au laits and the cast of characters took hold of my mind and transported me away from the fear gripping me.\n        Surgery was\u00a0followed by chemotherapy and then radiation. Between being immunocompromised and suffering side effects from my treatments, my world became quite small. With my limited energy, I plowed through one book after the next, relishing Inspector Gamache\u2019s mantra, \u201cAll will be well.\u201d I whispered these words to myself before every medical intervention.\n        On one especially uncomfortable night when sleep eluded me, I took my book and moved to an empty bedroom so as not to disturb my husband. Plumping the pillows and tucking into the twin bed, I was suddenly transported not to Three Pines, but to the bedroom of my childhood with a different book in hand,\u00a0\u201dThe Hidden Staircase,\u201d a Nancy Drew mystery.\n        My mother disapproved of Nancy Drew books, saying they were \u201cnot literature.\u201d Apparently, my local library shared her perspective because it didn\u2019t carry them. Whenever I saved enough money from my allowance, I would walk to the local five and 10 cent store and buy a Nancy Drew mystery and a Three Musketeers candy bar, another forbidden fruit in my home.\n        Climbing into bed with my contraband, flashlight in hand, I devoured my book and candy,\u00a0seeking comfort in Nancy\u2019s ability to bring order to the chaos of each book\u2019s dilemma. I don\u2019t remember the details of those books as much as learning from them that girls could solve problems and the world played fair, the bad guy always got caught.\n        The structure of these books was a stark contrast to the nightly fighting that filled my house. I was 10 years old, and my parents\u2019 marriage was splintering apart. Within the year my mother would leave without me.\n        Returning to my Louise Penny mystery that night, I realized that perhaps it was the memory of those lonely nights from my childhood that kept me from reading mystery books. I never wanted to feel fear like that again, and yet here I was afraid for what would become of my life if the cancer wasn\u2019t cured. Now the fight was within me instead of seeping through a shared bedroom wall. Could I really trust that all would be well?\n        It\u2019s been a long time since I believed the world is fair. And there is nothing fair about a cancer diagnosis. In contrast, my belief that girls can solve problems has only gotten stronger. The women physicians who took care of me are a stunning reminder of how the world has changed since my childhood.\n        But most of all, I still believe in the power of the written word to help us through dark nights when sleep is slow to come. There is no mystery in that.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/opinions/cancer-recovery-books-reading-mulqueen/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

President Bill Clinton, in his\u00a0successful 1996 reelection bid, spent the late months of his campaign\u00a0negotiating legislative deals\u00a0with a Republican-majority Congress. And President Barack Obama, in late October 2012, took time off the campaign trail in his ultimately\u00a0winning bid\u00a0to lead the federal response to\u00a0Hurricane Sandy\u00a0in the Northeast.\n        A bit over a year out from Election Day 2024,\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0is taking a similar approach, by dint of a morbid and tragic pair of international crises.\u00a0By taking a lightning-fast visit to Tel Aviv on Wednesday after a similar wartime visit to Ukraine a few months earlier, and making a primetime appeal to American voters Thursday to support both Israel and Ukraine in their wars against evil forces, Biden is reaping political dividends by\u00a0playing\u00a0the statesman.\n        Biden\u2019s efforts stand out even more than usual since his likely 2024 Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has been clumsy and ineffective in trying to insert himself into these news events, as when he\u00a0praised\u00a0Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terror group\u00a0based in Lebanon, in the wake of Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel. At the same time, the Republicans in office are in disarray as an increasingly embarrassing Republican leadership struggle in the House has paralyzed Capitol Hill.\n  Biden, in contrast, appears capable and steadfast. For 20 months, he has been a\u00a0stalwart defender\u00a0of Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia. And for nearly two weeks Biden demonstrated steely\u00a0support for Israel\u00a0as the Middle East\u2019s only democracy responds to Hamas\u2019\u00a0October 7 attacks\u00a0that claimed some 1,400 lives, among then 32 Americans. He noted during his TV address that his\u00a0quick trip\u00a0to Israel is the first of an American president to the country during war-time, while his touchdown in Ukraine in February was the first time a US president entered a warzone not controlled by the US.\n        Whatever\u00a0effect they have on the diplomatic front, Biden\u2019s\u00a0Israel trip\u00a0and Thursday night prime time\u00a0television address\u00a0can only help his reelection efforts at this point, especially if he faces Trump.\u00a0Both show\u00a0a confident, experienced commander-in-chief projecting gravitas and a deep knowledge of history, having made official\u00a0visits to Israel\u00a0going back to 1973 as a freshman senator from Delaware.\n        Biden made the long journey\u00a0despite predictable criticism\u00a0that he\u2019s tilted too far in Israel\u2019s direction at the expense of the Palestinians. Arab allies who he\u2019d hoped to meet with instead snubbed him, and Muslim protesters have taken to the streets in cities around the world in opposition to Israel and its American backers.\n        Many observers also said he didn\u2019t achieve much, but in Biden\u2019s roughly seven-and-a-half hour Israel visit\u00a0Wednesday, in which he met government officials,\u00a0first responders\u00a0and families of terror victims, among others, he was able to secure his two main goals: to reassure the Israeli public he stood with them and against terrorists, giving them strength for the fight as well as space to\u00a0demand concessions if needed. And he also hammered out a\u00a0limited plan for getting humanitarian aid into Gaza from Egypt\u00a0for civilians effectively trapped in the small territory, which will hopefully serve as a template for more to come.\n        But Biden\u2019s key audience was the domestic one. He wanted to win over the American public, and pro-Israel community specifically, which is why images of the president\u00a0hugging\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are so politically potent.\u00a0The Middle East trip by Biden, who turns 81 on November 20, also offered a none-to-subtle rejoinder to\u00a0GOP criticisms\u00a0that he\u2019s too old for a second term. (Granted, having\u00a0Air Force One\u00a0at the president\u2019s beck-and-call is an easier form of travel for the 12-hour Washington, DC,-to-Tel Aviv flight than an economy seat on El Al.)\n        Some Republicans even offered grudging praise for Biden\u2019s Israel trip. His urgent diplomatic mission sharply contrasts with House Republicans\u2019\u00a0infighting in Washington, where the inability of the majority party to\u00a0select a speaker\u00a0from among its own members\u00a0means the body can\u2019t take any steps to help the war effort. Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee even\u00a0called Biden\u2019s trip\u00a0a \u201cgutsy, bold move.\u201d\n        Biden also drew some plaudits from the right over his television address, which\u00a0directly appealed\u00a0to Americansfor support in the wars in Israel and Ukraine, including an\u00a0$100 billion aid package\u00a0he plans to send to Congress shortly (if there is a Congress).\u00a0He also underscored America\u2019s commitment to its leadership role in the world and the values it has historically promoted.\n        \u201cIt may be remembered as one of the best, if not the best, speeches of his presidency. He was firm, he was unequivocal, he was strong,\u201d Fox News political analyst\u00a0Brit Hume said\u00a0of Biden, offering rare praise.\n        Of course, many prominent conservatives still found grounds for panning the Democratic president. His trip\u00a0drew scorn\u00a0from 2024 Republican presidential candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, as well as\u00a0mockery\u00a0from Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham. \u201cHe was mumbling, reading his note cards and called Hamas \u2018the other team,\u2019\u201d Ingraham wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n        Nor has Biden been spared criticism from some Democrats. Members of the party\u2019s\u00a0far-left fringe\u00a0have\u00a0effectively blamed Israel\u00a0for taking defensive military measures against Hamas in Gaza after its terror attacks ended in the highest Jewish casualty count\u00a0since the Holocaust.\u00a0And the progressive wing has been making inroads into the Democratic Party\u2019s support for Israel as a whole. According to Gallup, Democratic support for Israel\u00a0has been sliding\u00a0for years.\u00a0Per one CBS News poll, a majority of Democrats don\u2019t favor sending extra weapons and supplies to Israel at this time.\n        More broadly, though, Biden is capitalizing on solid political ground. Massive majorities support sending humanitarian aid to Israel and a poll released by Quinnipiac\u00a0University\u00a0on Tuesday, roughly\u00a061% said\u00a0their sympathies lie with Israel. Even more voters (around 65%) agree with Biden that supporting Ukraine is in America\u2019s national interest.\n        So, on balance, Biden\u2019s resolute support\u00a0of Israel\u00a0is likely to help more than hurt, especially as it strengthens his centrist credentials. And swing voters are the ones Biden really needs to win reelection in 2024. At the same time, there\u2019s little evidence to date that progressives will break with him over support for Israel if Trump is the 2024 Republican nominee.\n        The foreign policy moves could particularly help with voters in swing states if they read it as him pushing back against his party\u2019s most extreme elements,\u00a0as some pro-Israel Democratic members\u00a0of Congress have done. It\u2019s a political formula mastered by Democratic presidential predecessors like\u00a0Clinton\u00a0and, in his own way,\u00a0Obama, ahead of their reelection wins: Clinton agreed to compromises with the Republican Congress on\u00a0welfare reform, the Defense of Marriage Act and a range of other issues. Obama, meanwhile, at points in his 2012 campaign touted\u00a0spending austerity,\u00a0deficit reduction\u00a0and extension of George W.\u00a0Bush-era tax cuts.\n        Voters for now are giving Biden\u00a0reasonably good reviews\u00a0for his handling of both Israel and Ukraine. He has a year to make that stick \u2014 a challenging task since most presidential elections since the end of the Cold War have been decided on domestic issues, rather than foreign affairs. Moreover, the situation is volatile, and Biden could end up looking bad if suffering in Gaza increases, a wider war takes place, American forces are killed, there are terror attacks on American soil, or any number of other negative possibilities happen. But Biden, for now, is nailing a key part of the job, just as Clinton and Obama did before him: being presidential.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/opinions/israel-gaza-biden-ukraine-russia-mark/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

I knew that look well.\n        Like him, I\u2019m an Arab, Muslim and American \u2014 an amalgam of identities that conjures up \u201cpariah\u201d in the world we live in. But now, it means something different. At this moment, when\u00a0the horror of mass death unfolds in Gaza\u00a0and on screens we hold in our palms, our identity spells absurdity.\n        We see ourselves in the people of Gaza. The accosted people there share our names, our faith, our culture and our customs. We have friends in that\u00a0140-square-mile\u00a0open-air prison turned into hell on earth, including\u00a0journalists who were sheltering at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital\u00a0at the time of the deadly blast on Wednesday.\n        But what we continue to see on our screens is still half a world away. On the other side of our terrestrial reality and this virtual insanity.\n        Until this past week.\n        \u201cA Palestinian boy was killed in Illinois,\u201d shared Abed. This sequence of foreign-to-domestic murder was a familiar one. Being American, like 6-year-old\u00a0Wadea Al-Fayoume\u00a0was, does not protect us from the stigma of being Palestinian or Arab, Muslim and from the \u201cMiddle East.\u201d Rather, these latter identities keep the security blanket of Americanness away from us, rendering us foreign and, during times of crisis, \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n        Wadea was stabbed 26 times last Saturday with a military-style knife by his family\u2019s landlord, a 71-year-old man who\u2019s been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other crimes. The attacker also stabbed Wadea\u2019s mother more than a dozen times. She\u00a0lived. But what does that word even mean anymore?\n        What does it mean for a mother who escaped war for the safety of an American suburb? What does it mean for Abed and I: an executive director of a civil rights\u00a0organization\u00a0and a law professor, standing at the crosshairs of American power and an Arab identity conflated with terrorism? What does \u201cliving\u201d mean for\u00a0millions of Arabs and Muslimswho call the United States home, burdened with the impossible task of proving their allegiance, over and over again, in response to bellowing demands that bury our humanity?\n        It feels like we are living on borrowed time, like we were extended a contingent citizenship that can be stripped at any time, on account of events that unfold in America or on the other side of the world.\n        Calling it \u201cIslamophobia\u201d would be a severe understatement. This existential ballad of being Arab or Muslim in America is far more onerous, far more absurd. It feels like an existence that has\u00a0no exit. A play where our daily routine is waking up to the news of war, the stark images and videos of slain children, rolling timelines of shattered villages and the roaring demands \u201cto condemn Hamas.\u201d While this plot sounds a lot like novels from Jean Paul Sartre or Albert Camus, this is not fiction.\n        This is our absurd reality.\n        An absurd reality where we, in America, can only post on virtual timelines where the footsteps of suspicion stomp out our voices and censor our speech.\n        Our names and nationalities, faces and faith brand us with the stain of collective guilt for crimes that we did not commit. Moments like this \u2014 like the\u00a0aftermath of 9/11\u00a0or the reckoning after former President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0Muslim Ban in 2017\u00a0\u2014 moved many to conceal their ethnicity or\u00a0cover\u00a0their faith, particularly women who removed their hijabs or young children who hid behind aliases. Hate crimes statistics skyrocketed after 9/11, and\u00a0reached\u00a0near proportions in the wake of the Muslim Ban.\u00a0Wadea\u2019s death foreshadows that these figures may spike again, and descend on the heads of Arab and Muslim Americans shadowed by suspicion.\n        But we cannot shed our bodies.\u00a0These are the corporal vehicles that connect us to the victims cast as villains in Gaza. And the symbols that tie us to distant places where \u201cwars on terror\u201d were wrought yesterday and are certain to wreck more lives tomorrow.\n        \u201cMuslims are only newsworthy when villains, never victims.\u201d I wrote those words, for the first time, as a law student weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks. I was much younger then, unprepared for what the world would come to be.\n        But I knew then that it would never be the same.\n        I typed those very eight words 20 years later in my\u00a0book, \u201cThe New Crusades: Islamophobia and the Global War on Muslims.\u201d\u00a0In between the wide-eyed optimism of a young law student and the sobered worldview of an aging law professor, 9/11 and today\u2019s war serve as bookends for morbid middle passages for Muslims in America and around the globe \u2013 as evidenced by the genocidal\u00a0campaigns\u00a0in China, persecution\u00a0in India, hijab and\u00a0abaya\u00a0bans in France, and far more.\u00a0The law and language of Islamophobia\u00a0have been\u00a0exported transnationally by an American \u201cwar on terror\u201d that was first enforced on the home front, upon the heads of Arabs and Muslims like me whose citizenship was cast aside.\n        Being American was no protection. Not then and definitely not now.\n        The barrage of cold stares and commands to condemn terrorism, assignment of collective guilt and characterization of our dead children as \u201ccollateral damage,\u201d not only strips us from the\u00a0substance\u00a0of citizenship, it renders us inhuman. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have ideas,\u201d wrote Carl Jung, \u201cIdeas have people.\u201d\n        And the idea that conflates our skin with terrorism not only grips the imagination of people, but sinks into the very marrow of American gates of power. We must\u00a0exist, whatever that even means anymore, within the very lines that divide our identities and sever us from normalcy.\n        While I am in Washington and not Chicago, I can feel every one of those 26 stabs that plunged into little Wadea\u2019s body. While across American cities large and small,\u00a0we\u00a0see ourselves in the grieving parents forced to bury their dead children in Gaza.\n        This is what it means to be us.\n        Perhaps it is time that this country begins to see us.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/21/opinions/how-arab-muslim-americans-feel-war-beydoun/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

Read\u00a0more opinion\u00a0on CNN.", "body": "      Scrolling through Instagram a few weeks ago,\u00a0a post from The Lily\u00a0stopped us in our tracks. After nearly six years, The Washington Post\u2019s hub for gender and identity coverage \u2014 which featured everything from\u00a0stories\u00a0by staff writer Caroline Kitchener, who would go on to win a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting on abortion after Roe v. Wade, to painfully relatable comics about parenting and friendship\u00a0\u2014 was signing off for good.\n        The announcement was a blow \u2014 not just for fans of The Lily, but for those still mourning The New York Times\u2019 excellent (and now defunct)\u00a0In Her Words newsletter. It\u2019s a discouraging trend: These spaces, beloved by readers, seem to be disappearing\u00a0just as the demand and need for them have never been higher. (Both The Post and The Times cited a desire to integrate gender coverage into broader reporting.)\n        The first so-called \u201cwomen\u2019s pages\u201d appeared in newspapers more than a\u00a0century\u00a0ago; they\u2019ve been a double-edged sword ever since. In the early days, they served up \u201csociety\u201d coverage alongside job opportunities for women reporters. As Sarah Jaffe pointed out in\u00a0Columbia Journalism Review, \u201cwhile reserving a separate space for \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019 meant that things like parenting, fashion, and the beginnings of the feminist movement got column inches, the separation also demarcated the women\u2019s page as the site of less newsy content.\u201d\n        Women journalists, at the time, were acutely aware of the risk of marginalization; more than a few enterprising reporters used this to their advantage, covering everything from war to sports from \u201cthe woman\u2019s angle.\u201d\n        The debate over the so-called \u201cpink ghetto\u201d continues today: Should we celebrate or bemoan the proud history of excellent reproductive health coverage in women\u2019s magazines? What does it mean when a story on equal pay is tagged under \u201cgender\u201d rather than \u201ceconomy\u201d? Is the\u00a0Style\u00a0section really the most natural fit for news of a leadership transition at Planned Parenthood?\u00a0As news outlets chronicle the devastation of the Israel-Hamas war, what will it take to see more mainstream reporting on the disproportionate toll of violent\u00a0conflict\u00a0on women and girls?\u00a0      The issues that affect women\u2019s lives are relevant to people of all genders \u2014 but it\u2019s clear that women\u2019s media outlets still have an essential role to play.\u00a0Ms.\u00a0Magazine was born out of a frustration that, in the words\u00a0of founder Gloria Steinem, \u201cthere really was nothing for women to read that was controlled by women.\u201d More than five decades later, the magazine is still going strong. Blogs like\u00a0Jezebel\u00a0and Feministing\u00a0launched careers, built community and provided a forum to cover issues like\u00a0abortion\u00a0with twice the nuance and none of the \u201cboth sides\u201d false equivalency of \u201cmainstream\u201d media outlets.\n        Many of the same journalists who got their start writing for feminist blogs or women\u2019s magazines (and some who still write for feminist blogs and women\u2019s magazines) are shaping coverage of presidential elections, providing sharp analysis of Supreme Court cases and breaking down complex policy issues for a wide range of platforms. When we see a byline from\u00a0Anna Holmes,\u00a0Erin Gloria Ryan,\u00a0Irin Carmon,\u00a0Jia Tolentino,\u00a0Laura Bassett,\u00a0Mattie Kahn,\u00a0Rebecca Traister,\u00a0Roxane Gay\u00a0or so many others,\u00a0we know we\u2019re in for a smart take on what\u2019s happening in the world.\n        Over the years, it\u2019s been heartening to see coverage of issues like\u00a0reproductive rights,\u00a0paid leave,\u00a0care work\u00a0and the\u00a0#MeToo\u00a0movement begin to make headlines in some of our country\u2019s most prestigious legacy media outlets (and even the occasional\u00a0men\u2019s magazine). It sends a message when a chilling\u00a0story\u00a0about a 13-year-old sexual assault survivor unable to access abortion is on the homepage of TIME, The New York Times spotlights child care\u00a0and\u00a0girlhood, CNN dedicates precious time and resources to investigative\u00a0reporting\u00a0on systemic gender inequality and The Washington Post puts the Black maternal mortality crisis front and\u00a0center.\n        If we\u2019ve seen progress when it comes to moving so-called women\u2019s issues from the margins to the mainstream, it\u2019s thanks in no small part to generations of mostly (though not only) women reporters willing to battle the powers that be, force important stories onto the front page, and insist that women\u2019s news is, well, news. And as thankful as we are to every exhausted reporter continuing to push this particular boulder up the hill, the onus shouldn\u2019t be on them.\n        As media companies compete for readership and fight to stay afloat, appealing to women isn\u2019t just a nice thing to do \u2014 it\u2019s a business imperative. In a 2020\u00a0report,\u00a0\u201cThe Missing Perspectives of Women in News,\u201d researcher Luba Kassova found that \u201cwomen are lighter news consumers than men globally.\u201d She wisely suggests: \u201cThis could be due partly to news being produced mainly by men, and focusing mainly on men \u2013 a problem exacerbated by the data gaps in understanding women\u2019s news needs.\u201d In other words, news outlets have some serious catching up to do when it comes to understanding half their potential audience.\n        In a recent\u00a0viral appearance, comedian Chelsea Handler told Jimmy Fallon: \u201cI think we are in a very important cultural moment, you know, with women dominating culture.\u201d\n        Consider the many articles that popped up this summer analyzing the financial\u00a0ripple effect\u00a0of Greta Gerwig\u2019s \u201cBarbie\u201d; Coco Gauff\u2019s\u00a0US Open\u00a0win; and Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9, whose tours together generated more than an estimated\u00a0$9 billion\u00a0in economic activity.\n        Women make up\u00a0slightly more than half\u00a0of the US population, have\u00a0out-voted men\u00a0in every presidential election of the past 60 years and control more than\u00a0$10 trillion\u00a0in household assets. (For more on the role of women in the economy \u2014 and the challenges that persist \u2014 check out the research of newly-minted Nobel Laureate, Claudia Goldin.) In a crowded media landscape, outlets that spend time talking \u2014 and listening \u2014 to women are well-positioned to identify breaking news before it breaks, a reality on vivid display in the days following last summer\u2019s Dobbs v. Jackson decision.\n        Heading into a presidential election where abortion will be\u00a0a defining issue\u00a0\u2014 if not\u00a0the\u00a0defining issue \u2014 this is a moment when every media outlet should be racing to expand its gender coverage, not backing away.\n        So what can readers do to encourage this? We can start by holding outlets accountable, demanding that they cover \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d with the rigor they deserve and employ reporters from all backgrounds \u2014 not just for the good of their own coverage but for the sake of our democracy, which benefits from having more voices in the conversation.\n        We can support platforms like The\u00a019th\u00a0News,\u00a0The Meteor\u00a0and\u00a0Rewire News Group, along with smaller independent outlets (we\u2019re big fans\u00a0of Jessica Valenti\u2019s\u00a0Abortion, Every Day). We can champion reporters covering these issues by reading their work and sharing it far and wide. And, of course, let\u2019s not forget that\u00a0publications such as Glamour,\u00a0Cosmopolitan,\u00a0InStyle,\u00a0Teen Vogue,\u00a0Elle,\u00a0Ebony\u00a0and\u00a0Essence\u00a0have long been ahead of the curve in juxtaposing in-depth political and health reporting with stories on fashion and entertainment. (Full disclosure: We have proudly written for, subscribed to, and otherwise supported many of these platforms.)\n        The day The Lily\u00a0posted\u00a0their last Instagram message,\u00a0the comments\u00a0section was awash in heartfelt reflections. \u201cI always read them and used their information in our work of women\u2019s rights activism in Venezuela,\u201d one commenter lamented. Reporters thanked The Lily for giving them their first big byline, or taking a chance on a topic other media outlets had deemed unimportant. \u201cYou guys are making me cry\u00a0\ud83d\ude2d\u00a0Thank you for all you did for young women in journalism\u00a0\u2764\ufe0f,\u201d read one response.\n        There were notes of gratitude for The Lily\u2019s coverage of Black women\u2019s health, LGBTQ families, postpartum anxiety, birth control and a host of other topics too often overlooked by media outlets. One commenter put it succinctly: \u201cThank you so much for seeing us.\u201d\n        That\u2019s the power of great reporting: It can hold a mirror up to society and shine a light on the unseen. The headlines we read help shape politics and public opinion, upend cultural norms and inspire people to act. Ultimately, gender coverage is too important to\u00a0be either/or; it has to be both/and. It matters how these stories are told\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and by whom, and where. We need an abundance of platforms like The Lily, serving as a complement to reporting on gender woven through every section: news, opinion, technology, health, politics, business, the arts. In the interim, wherever outlets place their gender coverage, one thing is clear: We need more of it, not less.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/21/opinions/the-lily-media-women-gender-coverage-richards-peterson/index.html", "section": "opinions"}

We can only hope\u00a0for another perfect score.\n    Correction: This essay has been updated to include the correct Olympic year for the 'Fierce Five.'", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/opinions/mary-lou-retton-gymnastics-virtual-vigil-bass/index.html", "section": "opinions"}
