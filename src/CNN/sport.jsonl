I\u2019m really more focused on our team and this year,\u201d the 71-year-old told reporters. \u201cWorry about that later. Thank you.\u201d\n        Belichick is the clubhouse leader in all-time playoff wins, Super Bowl appearances and Super Bowl wins, but Sunday\u2019s victory couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for the New England coach, with pressure beginning to mount on him following weeks of disappointing results.\n        It was a victory that came in the most impressive fashions too, upsetting their high-powered division rivals.\n        The Patriot\u2019s defense did an excellent job in stifling Josh Allen and the Bills just enough, while the New England offense broke out of the slump it has been in almost all season.\n        The Bills fought back in the second half and the Patriots needed a late score to win the game. That came from Jones leading his team on an impressive drive before connecting with Mike Gesicki for the winner \u2013 fitting given it was \u2018National Tight End\u2019 day.\n        \u201cI think just keep fighting and it\u2019s just a crumb, right?\u201d Jones told reporters afterwards. \u201cThat\u2019s what I always say. And you\u2019ve got to build off that.\n        \u201cYou\u2019ve got to build off that and attack every day the same. It\u2019s all about playing for each other, playing for the guy next to you and understanding why. So we did that today and we need to continue to do that every day in practice and in the games.\u201d\n        The Patriots improve to 2-5 while the Bills slip to 4-3.\n        The Kansas City Chiefs began their title defense with a disappointing Week 1 loss at home against the Detroit Lions.\n        But since then, they have been almost perfect, winning six games in a row including Sunday\u2019s impressive 31-17 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers.\n        Kansas City did it predominantly behind the brilliance of quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who threw for 424 passing yards and four touchdowns, as well as an interception.\n        Mahomes\u2019 favorite target was \u2013 as has become commonplace \u2013 Travis Kelce, who showed why he\u2019s the best tight end in the league, finishing with 12 catches, 179 yards and a touchdown with Taylor Swift watching on from the stands.\n        After the victory, Mahomes described why his connection with Kelce has worked so well over the years.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of things, but I think the main thing is how he\u2019s able to recognize coverage and adjust on the fly. We always talk about it, but it\u2019s something that you can\u2019t take for granted,\u201d Mahomes told reporters.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s playing Madden, like he can read the coverages and stop in the windows and be open and be on the same page as me at all times,\u201d added Mahomes, referring to the video game.\n        \u201cHe did a great job, man. He does it week in and week out and that\u2019s why he\u2019s the player that he is and why he\u2019ll be a Hall of Famer one day.\u201d\n        The Chargers had no answer to what the Chiefs brought to the table at Arrowhead, in particular in the first half where Mahomes racked up a remarkable 321 passing yards and three touchdowns.\n        But it was Kansas City\u2019s defense which arguably impressed the most, halting the usually dynamic Chargers offense, especially quarterback Justin Herbert.\n        The Chargers star finished with 259 passing yards, a touchdown and two interceptions \u2013 one apiece from Bryan Cook and L\u2019Jarius Sneed \u2013 and was sacked five times.\n        It\u2019s no wonder the Chiefs are predicted to make a deep run as they aim to retain their Super Bowl crown, improving to 6-1 while the Chargers slip to 2-4.\n        \u201cIt hasn\u2019t gone our way the past couple of games, but no one\u2019s going to panic, no one\u2019s going to quit, no one\u2019s going to give up,\u201d Herbert told reporters after the loss.\n        \u201cI know we\u2019re going to attack practice this week the same way we have each of the past weeks. So I\u2019m looking for the challenge, the opportunity. A tough week, but we\u2019re going to get better because of it.\u201d\n        Sunday\u2019s action ended with arguably the game of the week, as the Philadelphia Eagles \u2013 last season\u2019s Super Bowl runners-up \u2013 took on the neutral\u2019s new favorite, the Miami Dolphins.\n        Both had begun the season with five wins in six weeks and both had shown why they are seen as Super Bowl contenders.\n        But in a hard-fought game at Lincoln Financial Field, it was the Eagles who ended up victorious, beating Miami 31-17.\n        Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was the main talking point of the game, throwing touchdowns to AJ Brown and Dallas Goedert as well as rushing for another, but after the halftime interval, he jogged out a few minutes after the rest of his teammates with a brace on his knee.\n        The 25-year-old, known for his mobility, hadn\u2019t looked as dynamic as he had previously \u2013 losing a fumble as well as throwing an interception.\n        \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Hurts said when a reporter asked about his knee after the victory.\n        For Miami, it was a return to earth after a few weeks of offensive explosion.\n        The team had been on a historic pace on offense but was slowed down considerably by the Eagles defense, finishing with just 244 total yards.\n        Tua Tagovailoa, who is among the early season MVP candidates, remained accurate but the team\u2019s previously explosive running game was almost non-existent. Missing rookie sensation De\u2019Von Achane, the Dolphins could only muster 45 yards on the ground.\n        The Eagles now sit at 6-1 while the Dolphins move to 5-2.\n  Away vs. home      Detroit Lions 6-38 Baltimore Ravens\n        Las Vegas Raiders 12-30 Chicago Bears\n        Cleveland Browns 39-38 Indianapolis Colts\n        Buffalo Bills 25-29 New England Patriots\n        Washington Commanders 7-14 New York Giants\n        Atlanta Falcons 16-13 Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n        Pittsburgh Steelers 24-17 Los Angeles Rams\n        Arizona Cardinals 10-20 Seattle Seahawks\n        Green Bay Packers 17-19 Denver Broncos\n        Los Angeles Chargers 17-31 Kansas City Chiefs\n        Miami Dolphins 17-31 Philadelphia Eagles\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/sport/week-7-2023-nfl-season-review-spt-intl/index.html", "section": "sport"}

Retton, who in 2018 was on the ABC hit show \u201cDancing with the Stars,\u201d still has a long recovery road, Kelley said.\n  Pneumonia is a respiratory infection that can cause the lungs to fill with fluid, with symptoms that can range from mild to life threatening. Adults older than 65, children younger than 5 and those with other medical conditions are most at risk. The family did not specify the type of rare pneumonia diagnosis.\n        Retton was dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweetheart\u201d after winning five medals during the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. She parlayed that into appearances in movies, TV shows, ads and on the front of boxes of Wheaties.\n        She was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1997.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/sport/mary-lou-retton-hospital-release-spt-intl/index.html", "section": "sport"}

I\u2019m really more focused on our team and this year,\u201d the 71-year-old told reporters. \u201cWorry about that later. Thank you.\u201d\n        Belichick is the clubhouse leader in all-time playoff wins, Super Bowl appearances and Super Bowl wins, but Sunday\u2019s victory couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for the New England coach, with pressure beginning to mount on him following weeks of disappointing results.\n        It was a victory that came in the most impressive fashions too, upsetting their high-powered division rivals.\n        The Patriot\u2019s defense did an excellent job in stifling Josh Allen and the Bills just enough, while the New England offense broke out of the slump it has been in almost all season.\n        The Bills fought back in the second half and the Patriots needed a late score to win the game. That came from Jones leading his team on an impressive drive before connecting with Mike Gesicki for the winner \u2013 fitting given it was \u2018National Tight End\u2019 day.\n        \u201cI think just keep fighting and it\u2019s just a crumb, right?\u201d Jones told reporters afterwards. \u201cThat\u2019s what I always say. And you\u2019ve got to build off that.\n        \u201cYou\u2019ve got to build off that and attack every day the same. It\u2019s all about playing for each other, playing for the guy next to you and understanding why. So we did that today and we need to continue to do that every day in practice and in the games.\u201d\n        The Patriots improve to 2-5 while the Bills slip to 4-3.\n        The Kansas City Chiefs began their title defense with a disappointing Week 1 loss at home against the Detroit Lions.\n        But since then, they have been almost perfect, winning six games in a row including Sunday\u2019s impressive 31-17 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers.\n        Kansas City did it predominantly behind the brilliance of quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who threw for 424 passing yards and four touchdowns, as well as an interception.\n        Mahomes\u2019 favorite target was \u2013 as has become commonplace \u2013 Travis Kelce, who showed why he\u2019s the best tight end in the league, finishing with 12 catches, 179 yards and a touchdown with Taylor Swift watching on from the stands.\n        After the victory, Mahomes described why his connection with Kelce has worked so well over the years.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of things, but I think the main thing is how he\u2019s able to recognize coverage and adjust on the fly. We always talk about it, but it\u2019s something that you can\u2019t take for granted,\u201d Mahomes told reporters.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s playing Madden, like he can read the coverages and stop in the windows and be open and be on the same page as me at all times,\u201d added Mahomes, referring to the video game.\n        \u201cHe did a great job, man. He does it week in and week out and that\u2019s why he\u2019s the player that he is and why he\u2019ll be a Hall of Famer one day.\u201d\n        The Chargers had no answer to what the Chiefs brought to the table at Arrowhead, in particular in the first half where Mahomes racked up a remarkable 321 passing yards and three touchdowns.\n        But it was Kansas City\u2019s defense which arguably impressed the most, halting the usually dynamic Chargers offense, especially quarterback Justin Herbert.\n        The Chargers star finished with 259 passing yards, a touchdown and two interceptions \u2013 one apiece from Bryan Cook and L\u2019Jarius Sneed \u2013 and was sacked five times.\n        It\u2019s no wonder the Chiefs are predicted to make a deep run as they aim to retain their Super Bowl crown, improving to 6-1 while the Chargers slip to 2-4.\n        \u201cIt hasn\u2019t gone our way the past couple of games, but no one\u2019s going to panic, no one\u2019s going to quit, no one\u2019s going to give up,\u201d Herbert told reporters after the loss.\n        \u201cI know we\u2019re going to attack practice this week the same way we have each of the past weeks. So I\u2019m looking for the challenge, the opportunity. A tough week, but we\u2019re going to get better because of it.\u201d\n        Sunday\u2019s action ended with arguably the game of the week, as the Philadelphia Eagles \u2013 last season\u2019s Super Bowl runners-up \u2013 took on the neutral\u2019s new favorite, the Miami Dolphins.\n        Both had begun the season with five wins in six weeks and both had shown why they are seen as Super Bowl contenders.\n        But in a hard-fought game at Lincoln Financial Field, it was the Eagles who ended up victorious, beating Miami 31-17.\n        Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was the main talking point of the game, throwing touchdowns to AJ Brown and Dallas Goedert as well as rushing for another, but after the halftime interval, he jogged out a few minutes after the rest of his teammates with a brace on his knee.\n        The 25-year-old, known for his mobility, hadn\u2019t looked as dynamic as he had previously \u2013 losing a fumble as well as throwing an interception.\n        \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Hurts said when a reporter asked about his knee after the victory.\n        For Miami, it was a return to earth after a few weeks of offensive explosion.\n        The team had been on a historic pace on offense but was slowed down considerably by the Eagles defense, finishing with just 244 total yards.\n        Tua Tagovailoa, who is among the early season MVP candidates, remained accurate but the team\u2019s previously explosive running game was almost non-existent. Missing rookie sensation De\u2019Von Achane, the Dolphins could only muster 45 yards on the ground.\n        The Eagles now sit at 6-1 while the Dolphins move to 5-2.\n  Away vs. home      Detroit Lions 6-38 Baltimore Ravens\n        Las Vegas Raiders 12-30 Chicago Bears\n        Cleveland Browns 39-38 Indianapolis Colts\n        Buffalo Bills 25-29 New England Patriots\n        Washington Commanders 7-14 New York Giants\n        Atlanta Falcons 16-13 Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n        Pittsburgh Steelers 24-17 Los Angeles Rams\n        Arizona Cardinals 10-20 Seattle Seahawks\n        Green Bay Packers 17-19 Denver Broncos\n        Los Angeles Chargers 17-31 Kansas City Chiefs\n        Miami Dolphins 17-31 Philadelphia Eagles\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/sport/week-7-2023-nfl-season-review-spt-intl/index.html", "section": "sport"}
