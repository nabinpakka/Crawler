Emerson, 44, has been charged in federal court with interfering with a flight crew, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Oregon announced Tuesday. That charge comes on the heels of dozens of state charges in Oregon, including 83 felony counts of attempted murder, 83 counts of reckless endangerment and one count of endangering an aircraft, booking records show. \n        Emerson attempted to cut fuel to the plane\u2019s engines while the flight was en route from Washington state to San Francisco on Sunday, according to authorities. But it was the quick action of the aircraft\u2019s captain and first officer that kept the engines from failing completely, the airline said. \n        Emerson was subdued by members of the flight crew but then attempted to grab the handle of an emergency exit during the flight\u2019s descent, according to a release from the US attorney\u2019s office. \n        The flight was forced to divert to Portland, Oregon, where the suspect was taken into custody by Port of Portland police, the agency said in a statement.\n        While in custody, Emerson told a police officer he became depressed about six months ago, according to an affidavit authored by an FBI agent and included alongside the federal complaint. Emerson denied taking any medications, the affidavit says, but he did discuss psychedelic mushrooms with the responding officer.\n        \u201cThe officer and Emerson talked about the use of psychedelic mushrooms and Emerson said it was his first-time taking mushrooms,\u201d the affidavit says.\n        Asked specifically if Emerson told officers he had been under the influence of mushrooms at the time of the incident, a spokesperson for the US Attorney\u2019s Office in Oregon told CNN that remains part of their ongoing investigation.\n        While in custody, Emerson said he was \u201cadmitting to what I did,\u201d per the affidavit. \u201cI\u2019m not fighting any charges you want to bring against me, guys,\u201d he said. \n        Emerson is being held without bail at the Multnomah County Jail and is expected in court on the state charges Tuesday afternoon. Online records do not list an attorney for Emerson, and CNN has been working to determine if he has legal representation in both state and federal court.\n        Authorities do not believe the incident was an act of terrorism or ideologically motivated violence, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN. Investigators believe it may have been the result of a mental health episode, and authorities are preparing for court officials to order an assessment of the defendant\u2019s psychological state as part of court proceedings, the source said.\n        Here\u2019s what we know.  \n        After taking off from Everett, Washington, on Sunday, Alaska Airlines Flight 2059 \u2013 operated by regional carrier Horizon Air \u2013 reported a \u201csecurity threat related to an off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot, identified as Captain Joseph Emerson, who was traveling in the flight deck jump seat,\u201d the airline said in a statement. \n        Pilots will sometimes ride in a cockpit \u201cjump seat\u201d when traveling in their official capacity or commuting between airports. \n        While in the cockpit, Emerson had tried to shut down both of the Embraer 175\u2019s engines by pulling its fire extinguisher handles, the airline said. \n        \u201cThe fire suppression system consists of a T-handle for each engine; when pulled, a valve in the wing closes to shut off fuel to the engine,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a statement to CNN. \u201cAfter they are pulled, some residual fuel remains in the line.\u201d \n        The airline said the quick reaction of the crew to reset both handles helped restore the flow of fuel and prevented the engines from cutting out. \n        \u201cOur crew responded without hesitation to a difficult and highly unusual situation, and we are incredibly proud and grateful for their skillful actions,\u201d the airline said in a statement. \n        Emerson initially engaged the pilots in small talk about the weather and the aircraft, the affidavit says. He then said, \u201cI\u2019m not OK,\u201d and one of the pilots turned around to see him reaching up and grabbing the red fire handles, the affidavit says. \n        One of the pilots grabbed Emerson\u2019s wrist while the other declared an inflight emergency, the affidavit says. One pilot said Emerson \u201cinitially resisted,\u201d and the two \u201cwrestled\u201d for about half a minute before Emerson agreed to leave the cockpit. \n        \u201cI think he\u2019s subdued,\u201d one of the plane\u2019s pilots can be heard saying in air traffic control audio recorded by LiveATC.net. \u201cOther than that, we want law enforcement as soon as we get on the ground and are parked.\u201d\n        After \u201cpeacefully walking to the back of the plane,\u201d the affidavit says Emerson told a flight attendant, \u201cYou need to cuff me right now or it\u2019s going to be bad.\u201d \n        The crew cuffed his wrists, but during the descent, Emerson \u201cturned towards an emergency exit door and tried to grab the handle,\u201d and was stopped by a flight attendant, the affidavit says. \n        \u201cAnother flight attendant observed Emerson make statements such as, \u2018I messed everything up\u2019 and that \u2018he tried to kill everybody,\u2019\u201d the affidavit says. \u201cEmerson was heard saying he had just put 84 peoples\u2019 lives at risk tonight including his own.\u201d\n        When the flight landed at Portland International Airport around 6:30 p.m., the suspect was taken into custody by Port of Portland police officers, the port said. \n        No injuries were reported on the flight, the FBI said.\n        All passengers were later able to fly to San Francisco with a new crew and aircraft, the airline said, noting it is \u201creaching out to each of them individually to discuss their experience and check-in on their well-being.\u201d\n        The FBI and the Port of Portland police are investigating the incident, authorities said. \n        The FBI\u2019s Portland field office confirmed its investigation in a statement Monday and assured travelers there is \u201cno continuing threat related to this incident.\u201d \n        The Federal Aviation Administration also said it is supporting local law enforcement in the investigation. \n        The FAA said it has briefed other airlines on preliminary details of the incident and informed carriers the incident is not related to \u201ccurrent world events\u201d \u2013 apparently referring to the war in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas.  \n        Two passengers on the flight told CNN that the airline crew maintained a calm environment on the plane as the incident played out. \n        Aubrey Gavello, one of the passengers, said she didn\u2019t realize something was wrong until a flight attendant announced over the loudspeaker that the plane needed to land immediately.\n        \u201cWe didn\u2019t know where we were landing, and we didn\u2019t know what was wrong. But (the flight attendant) assured us we were safe,\u201d Gavello said on CNN\u2019s \u201cLaura Coates Live\u201d on Monday night. \n        Later, the pilot informed passengers through the loudspeaker that there had been a \u201cdisturbance in the cockpit,\u201d said Alex Wood, who was seated at the front of the plane. Wood said he was wearing headphones and slept through the incident. \n        \u201cI was right by the cockpit, but nothing woke me up. Nothing was loud enough, nothing was rambunctious enough to wake me up,\u201d Wood said. \n        About five police officers boarded the plane after it landed and escorted the suspect off the aircraft, Gavello recalled. She noted he was calm and cooperative and had his hands secured by zip ties. \n        After Emerson was taken off the plane, a flight attendant announced on the loudspeaker that \u201che had a mental breakdown,\u201d Gavello told CNN affiliate KGO.\n        \u201cProps to the Alaska crew for keeping everyone calm,\u201d Gavello told CNN. \n        \u201cIt was all handled super well,\u201d said Wood.\n        The pair said they didn\u2019t realize the gravity of the situation Monday, when they woke to news headlines about the suspect trying to shut down the plane engines. \n        \u201cI\u2019m honestly grateful that we didn\u2019t know anything when they rebooked us and got us on a second plane,\u201d Gavello said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have felt comfortable doing that if we had all the information.\u201d\n        Emerson\u2019s neighbor, Ed Yee, told CNN it was \u201cvery shocking\u201d to hear of the suspect\u2019s alleged actions. \n        \u201cHe seems like a really nice guy. Nothing abnormal about him,\u201d Yee said.\n        Emerson had his most recent FAA medical examination last month, records show. He has a first-class medical certificate, the highest level of medical certificate awarded by the agency, which requires examinations every six months for pilots 40 and over.\n        Emerson has worked in aviation for at least two decades, according to information shared by Alaska Airlines. \n        He first joined the Alaska Air Group in 2001 as a first officer with Horizon. In 2012, Emerson left Horizon and joined Virgin America as a pilot. \n        After Alaska Airlines acquired Virgin America in 2016, Emerson became a first officer with Alaska and worked about three more years to become a pilot for the airline, according to the airline statement.\n        \u201cThroughout his career, Emerson completed his mandated FAA medical certifications in accordance with regulatory requirements, and at no point were his certifications denied, suspended or revoked,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a statement. \n        FAA records show Emerson held an Airline Transport Pilot certification with ratings to fly the Airbus A320, Boeing 737, Canadair Regional Jet, and De Havilland Dash 8. He did not hold a certification to fly the ERJ 175, those records indicate, the type of airplane in use during Sunday\u2019s incident.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/us/alaska-airlines-disruption-off-duty-pilot-tuesday/index.html", "section": "us"}

Du Bois \u2013 both members of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. \u2013 lead the movement for racial justice in the United States.  \n        Today, the Divine Nine organizations boast hundreds of chapters across the US and around the world. Traditions such as stepping, which is a blend of African traditional movements and American dance styles, are often associated with Divine Nine organizations. \n        But they have also maintained their commitment to philanthropy and service through scholarships, community service and programs to develop their members personally and professionally.\n        \u201cWe\u2019re usually the first people that people turn to for help,\u201d Ross said, adding that Divine Nine organizations play a central role in the Black community and often provide mentorship and guidance to the next generation.  \n        There is also an exclusivity of who adorns the letters, the organizations say. To even be considered for membership, there are certain academic and community service requirements that must be met along with commitment to upholding moral character. \n        \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of dedication that goes with becoming a member \u2026 You\u2019re pledging yourself to work on behalf of your community with those representing something larger than yourself. And it takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice to do so.\u201d\n        Black Greek-letter organizations distinguish themselves with colors, calls and letters. And, as a show of pride and to signify their membership, those in the organizations wear clothing and items bearing their Greek symbols also known as \u201cparaphernalia.\u201d  \n        Ross told CNN it is even included in the organizations\u2019 protocols that their paraphernalia is only to be worn by duly initiated members and there are rules around when and where to be dressed in the letters.\n        According to CNN affiliate WTVF, the Nashville teacher at the center of controversy around the second grade student\u2019s AKA t-shirt, also sent an email to the child\u2019s mom explaining that, \u201cAKA branded items are trademarked and reserved for members only.\u201d \n        While some Divine Nine members on social media said they understood the teacher\u2019s actions because the child should not have been wearing the shirt, others disagreed and said the teacher went a step too far by removing a 7-year-old\u2019s clothes.\n        Other recent incidents of people who are not members wearing paraphernalia or using hand signs have also sparked anger and backlash among some members.   \n        Actress Amanda Seales faced criticism in 2021 for wearing the AKA letters in an episode of  the television series \u201cInsecure.\u201d Though her character was described as a member of the organization, Seales was criticized by some on social media for wearing the sorority\u2019s letters because she herself was not a member.  \n        Rapper Boosie BadAzz has also faced online backlash for wearing Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., paraphernalia and apologized in 2020 after he posted pictures in the fraternity\u2019s t-shirt. \n        Ross encourages people to research and learn more about Divine Nine sorority and fraternity culture. But, he said, once a person is aware, they should be respectful of the organizations\u2019 cultures and traditions. \n        \u201cAll of these things are culturally relevant, you should listen to understand,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t understand what our devotion is and has been in the Black community \u2026 without understanding the Divine Nine.\u201d\n        For Divine Nine sororities and fraternities, membership doesn\u2019t end once a person graduates from college, it can be extended through graduate school chapters and lasts for a lifetime.  \n        \u201cMembership continues because that\u2019s our connection to our greater goal,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a localized college experience. Our college experience has to be able to go back into the community, has to go back into our family, has to go back and lift the people who were not able to go to college or aspire to go to college, or their kids aspire to go to college.\u201d  \n        Some of the organizations also extend honorary membership to those who have excelled significantly in their careers or made notable contributions to society. In July, US Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson became an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.\n        Together, members celebrate each other\u2019s milestones, such as graduations and weddings, with songs and chants. Members are also eulogized in memorial services after their death.   \n        \u201cThe lifelong bond is built through lifelong service,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWe are in the experience business and because we all have experiences that impact our lives, that bond never goes away.\u201d\n  Disclaimer: Chandelis Duster is a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.

And many victims sought medical help on their own, authorities said. \n        Meteorologists earlier said \u201csuper fog\u201d had heavily impacted the area, just west of New Orleans, around the time of the pileups. Super fog is a thick fog that develops in damp, smoky conditions and can send visibilities plummeting to less than 10 feet, according to the National Weather Service.\n        Some of the vehicles caught on fire after the initial crash, authorities said. One of the vehicles involved in the wrecks was a tanker truck carrying \u201chazardous liquid,\u201d police said without elaborating on the substance.\n        Police were working Monday evening to move the truck due to a \u201ccompromised tank/trailer.\u201d\n        \u201cOnce the tanker is removed, first responders will be able to better assess the vehicles in that immediate area. It is possible that additional fatalities could be located,\u201d state police added.\n        Authorities have asked the public to reach out if they have a missing family member who was traveling through the area Monday morning. \n        Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he was praying for those killed and wounded in the crashes. \n        \u201cThe combination of wildfire smoke and dense fog is dangerous, and I want to encourage all Louisianans in affected areas to take extreme caution while traveling,\u201d Edwards said on X, formerly known as Twitter. \n        \u201cI also want to thank the first responders and medical personnel who have worked so diligently to save lives and render aid,\u201d the governor added. \u201cThe best way you can help them, besides exercising caution on the road, is to donate blood at your local blood donation center. It will help replenish supplies that are being drained today to care for the wounded.\u201d\n        Earlier, St. John the Baptist Parish Sheriff Mike Tregre told CNN affiliate WVUE about three 18-wheel trucks collided in the northbound lanes and were fully engulfed in flames. In the southbound lanes, there were two reported multi-car pileups, one of which was also producing flames.\n        According to Tregre, all first responders had to be on foot because the crashes left the area \u201ccompletely gridlocked.\u201d \n        \u201cThe situation is pretty bad,\u201d he added.\n        Visibility levels were below a quarter mile at a nearby weather station from just after 4 a.m. CDT until just before 10 a.m. CDT. Visibility likely neared zero at times throughout the morning when the fog was at its densest.\n        The incredibly dense fog, known as \u201csuper fog,\u201d was caused by fog combining with smoke from nearby fires. \n        Louisiana has battled unprecedented wildfires, extreme heat and relentless drought since the summer. Exceptional drought, the highest category tracked by the US Drought Monitor, is in place across 62% of the state. \n        In a statement Monday, the city of New Orleans said it is monitoring an active fire burning underground in forested wetlands between Bayou Sauvage National Urban Wildlife Refuge and the Michoud Canal.\n        The lack of rain combined with the summer\u2019s extreme heat dried out wetlands and reduced the water table\u2019s depth, the city said. The blaze being monitored has been burning at and below surface level, it added. \n        A repeat of Monday\u2019s super fog is unlikely for Tuesday morning as \u201cwinds should be much stronger,\u201d the National Weather Service in New Orleans said Monday on X, previously known as Twitter. Winds need to be calm or very light in order for dense fog to form.\n        Patchy areas of dense fog may be possible but will not be as widespread as Monday, the city said, citing the weather service.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/us/louisiana-fog-i55-crash-new-orleans/index.html", "section": "us"}

", "body": "      T\u2019Yonna Major was a 9-year-old girl with an oversized heart \u2013 a ravenous reader, a generous friend, a loving daughter \u2014 and she was a fearless vaulter.  \n        Vaulting requires athletes to run full speed directly at a solid object that is often taller than they are and attempt to leap up and over it.  \n        \u201cThere\u2019s an innate fear in learning how to vault,\u201d at least for \u201cnormal humans,\u201d says veteran gymnastics coach Donna Alexin. \n        T\u2019Yonna was not a normal kid. \n        \u201cShe just ate it up. She was never scared. She would have run through the vault if she had to,\u201d Alexin said.    \n        On the evening of February 22, T\u2019Yonna should have been at the Orlando Metro Gymnastics gym, where she never missed a practice. But a stranger with a gun went on a shooting spree in Orange County, Florida, first killing 38-year-old Nathacha Augustin and then 24-year-old Dylan Lyons, who was covering the story for CNN affiliate Spectrum News 13. The gunman then walked into T\u2019Yonna\u2019s home at random and shot her and her mother. T\u2019Yonna was killed. \n        From the time T\u2019Yonna\u2019s parents, Brandi and Tokiyo Major, brought her home from the hospital, they knew she was going places \u2013 literally.   \n        \u201cShe was walking at the age of eight months,\u201d Brandi said. That\u2019s months earlier than the one-year mark when many babies start walking. \u201cShe skipped crawling. She used to scoot around on her butt and went straight to walking.\u201d \n        \u201cI just knew she was gonna be something.\u201d      \n        By age 3, she was tumbling around everywhere, jumping and flipping, Brandi said.     \n        Brandi and Tokiyo signed her up for gymnastics, and her world opened up. The whole family could see she was a natural, T\u2019Yonna\u2019s uncle, Dominic Major, said.      \n        \u201cI remember, when I came down to visit from Chicago, we were at my mother\u2019s house. She started climbing on the table and flipping. It was like, \u2018Oh my God. She\u2019s a little gymnast,\u2019\u201d Dominic said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what she was.\u201d   \n        Two gymnastics classes a week weren\u2019t enough for T\u2019Yonna, so Brandi and Tokiyo got the equipment she needed to practice at home. \n  Read other profiles of children who\u2019ve died from gunfire      \u201cShe ate gymnastics. She slept it. She\u2019d wake up in the morning, hit the bars, the balance beam,\u201d Tokiyo said. She would practice her routines so many times that the whole family knew them by heart.\n        T\u2019Yonna applied that drive to everything she did in life. She didn\u2019t just like to help her parents out in the kitchen, she was going to be a professional chef. She didn\u2019t just enjoy reading, she devoured over 100 books last year.   \n        The \u201cDiary of a Wimpy Kid\u201d series was one of her favorites. Tokiyo read T\u2019Yonna to sleep every night, and because Brandi worked nights, T\u2019Yonna would read her mom to sleep.  \n        T\u2019Yonna is one of more than 1,300 children and teens killed by a gun so far in 2023, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Firearms became the No. 1 killer of children and teens in America in 2020, surpassing motor vehicle accidents, which had long been the leading cause of death among America\u2019s youth. \n        The man who is charged with killing T\u2019Yonna, then 19-year-old Keith Moses, is facing three counts of first-degree murder, among other charges, for the crimes he committed on the day of the shooting. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n        Police haven\u2019t said whether there was a motive for the shooting.\n        On what would have been T\u2019Yonna\u2019s first day of fourth grade, Yaya\u2019s Dream Foundation, the nonprofit T\u2019Yonna\u2019s family founded shortly after her death, gave out 100 book bags filled with essential supplies at the elementary school she attended.   \n        The services the group provides are meant to capture the spirit of T\u2019Yonna\u2019s generosity \u2013 the way she would lay her toys out for other kids in the neighborhood to take once she had outgrown them, watching with excitement as they found new homes, or how she insisted her parents keep a second bicycle at the house, so any friend who came over to spend the night could ride one too.\n        The foundation also advocates for more responsible gun laws, to reduce violence in the community.   \n        \u201cWe\u2019re trying to\u2026 We\u2019re going to \u2013 there ain\u2019t no trying \u2013 we\u2019re going to keep her name going,\u201d Tokiyo said.     \n        \u201cEvery day that she was here, it was just a good memory,\u201d he said. But the Mondays and Wednesdays that Tokiyo took T\u2019Yonna to gymnastics practice were especially good memories.  \n        \u201cCoaches aren\u2019t supposed to have favorites, but there was just something really special about her,\u201d Alexin said.      \n        If there was a trick she had yet to nail, T\u2019Yonna would ask Alexin for feedback, and then she\u2019d practice it over, and over and over again until she nailed it. When she learned that college scholarships existed for gymnastic athletes, she was determined to get one.      \n        \u201cI told her every day, you\u2019re going to do NCAA gymnastics someday,\u201d Alexin said.    \n        She studied videos of the pros doing gymnastics \u2013 Gabby Douglas, Simone Biles \u2013 she memorized their movements, their tricks and tics.      \n        Tokiyo said they must have watched the \u201cGabby Douglas Story\u201d a million times.      \n        \u201cYeah, we watched that movie a lot,\u201d Brandi said.   \n  Gun violence is an epidemic in the US. Here are 4 things you can do today      It wasn\u2019t just the household names. T\u2019Yonna studied videos of gymnasts who were winning medals at every level, including Soraya Hawthorne, one of the gymnasts Alexin trained. T\u2019Yonna studied videos of her competing and took note of how Soraya would tap her heart and point to the sky when she would compete, as a tribute to her father, Alexin said.  \n        It wasn\u2019t long before T\u2019Yonna started earning her own medals \u2013 24 in just two years.     \n        \u201cWhen I\u2019d get there and I\u2019d see what she does, I\u2019d just be so floored,\u201d Brandi said. \u201cLook at my baby.\u201d      \n        But it wasn\u2019t enough for T\u2019Yonna to win on her own. \n        \u201cThere were nine other little girls on the team, and they all looked up to her,\u201d Alexin said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t name a captain, but she was the captain.\u201d     \n        One of T\u2019Yonna\u2019s teammates, 9-year-old McKenna, said T\u2019Yonna was the best gymnast on the team.  \n        \u201cShe was the first one to get her back handspring on floor,\u201d McKenna said.    \n        T\u2019Yonna was serious when it came to competing, but even at competitions, she was always having a good time.   \n        \u201cShe would dance around in line when we were waiting to compete,\u201d McKenna said.    \n        T\u2019Yonna loved unicorns. Now the girls share a stuffed unicorn, clad with a little leotard, in her memory.  \n        \u201cCaptain, fearless, kind\u2026best teammate ever.\u201d   \n        The other young gymnasts on T\u2019Yonna\u2019s team gathered after they lost her and called out characteristics that T\u2019Yonna brought to the sport. They decided that when one of the girls excelled \u2013 when they were brave, or strong or determined, the way T\u2019Yonna was \u2014 Alexin would award them a \u201cT-point.\u201d   \n        A couple of weeks later, Alexin offered the girls the chance to redeem their points for prizes. They unanimously decided they would rather have the T-points\n        \u201cThose T-points had meaning to them greater than some prize,\u201d Alexin said.    \n        Now, Alexin says, when one of the girls sticks a landing, they take a moment, tap their heart and point up to T\u2019Yonna.  \n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/us/tyonna-major-us-gun-deaths-gdpr/index.html", "section": "us"}

Authorities have not identified a suspect in the case and it\u2019s still unclear what led up to the killing.\n        Woll\u2019s family and friends gathered Sunday to share their final goodbyes during her funeral service. They remembered her kindness and the love she had for other people while lamenting on the unknowns of why this happened to her.\n        In his statement Sunday, White, the police chief, said investigators are working with the FBI to \u201cforensically analyze all of the information obtained up to this point in an effort to ascertain the timeline that ultimately led to Ms. Woll\u2019s death.\u201d\n        \u201cIndividuals with information that may further this investigation are being interviewed,\u201d White said.\n        \u201cI again ask the community to remain patient while our investigators and law enforcement partners continue their work,\u201d the chief added.

She also noted how much Woll loved her friends and family \u2013 including her nieces and nephews, to whom she would always bring books and markers, so they could learn new things and also spend time being creative.\n        Before her killing, the last text message Woll sent was a heart to friend, \u201cjust because,\u201d her sister said. On Saturday, another friend received flowers for their birthday that Woll had sent before she died. \n        \u201cYour soul was beautiful and pure,\u201d Woll Rosen said during the service Sunday.  \u201cYou so deeply wanted peace for this world, you fought for everyone, regardless of who they were or where they came from. You were the definition of a leader.\u201d\n        Woll\u2019s brother-in-law Ben also recalled how she always worked to bring people together and read aloud a recent response Woll had sent during a \u201csomewhat heated family email discussion.\u201d\n        \u201cIf and where there are disconnects between some of the people who follow Black Lives Matter and the Jewish community, then our communities need to engage with each other more, not less,\u201d Woll had written.\n        \u201cThis is your legacy,\u201d her brother-in-law said, \u201cthat we will always remember and carry forward.\u201d\n        In an obituary, Woll\u2019s loved ones wrote she loved \u201call forms of art,\u201d including theater and opera, loved being in nature, had worked with several political campaigns and was also involved with many interfaith organizations.\n        \u201cShe was unfailing in her commitment to living in the moment and always saw the good in everyone she met,\u201d it said. \u201cSamantha will always be remembered for her tireless activism and for her passion to make the world a better place. She was an angel and there was truly no one kinder.\u201d\n        Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, whose campaign Woll had been part of, also spoke at the service, highlighting Woll\u2019s encouraging and compassionate character and her powerful ability to connect with others. \n        \u201cShe could charm everyone. She charmed celebrities and naysayers alike. Her warmth could persuade even the hardest heart of the loudest heckler,\u201d Nessel said. \u201cSam gave everything of herself but she asked for nothing in return.\u201d\n        \u201cSamantha Woll may have been the nicest person that I have ever met, or will ever meet, in my lifetime,\u201d she said.\n        MoReno Taylor II, who worked with Woll on Nessel\u2019s reelection campaign in 2022, previously said her death was \u201ca devastating loss.\u201d \n        \u201cSam was a bright ball of light,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cShe lit up every room that she walked into. She always had a huge smile. She always gave you a firm handshake and asked about you, wanted to get to know who you were.\u201d\n        He remembered Woll as a kind soul who was always involved in her community and was dedicated to giving back.\n        \u201cShe didn\u2019t deserve this, and I really hope that they find a resolution to this as soon as possible and find whoever is responsible,\u201d he said. \n        Taylor said he knew Woll for five years, and thought of her as a little sister. \n        \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to imagine that someone who was so genuine and so kind could befall this kind of tragedy,\u201d he added.\n        Woll had also previously worked with Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, according to a post on Slotkin\u2019s social media.\n        The congresswoman said Woll \u201cdedicated her short life to building understanding across faiths, bringing light in the face of darkness.\u201d\n        The Democrat said Woll worked for her by helping set up the office and leading it throughout her first term.\n        \u201cMy heart aches that we have lost someone so dedicated to serving others in such a senseless act.

And we didn\u2019t know where or what or who they were.\u201d \n  ", "body": "      Her instinct was to run. She\u2019s an elfin 84-year-old with bright, engaging eyes. She wears her hair tied back and speaks with a similar no-nonsense style. \u201cIn those hours, it was just constant panic,\u201d she told CNN after leaving Jerusalem and landing safely back home in Southern California. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death, but of what can come before.\u201d \n        Hauptman is a Holocaust survivor. So, this was the second time she\u2019d fled a group targeting Jews. She fled Hamas in Israel in 2023 by plane as an old lady. She fled the Nazis in Italy in 1944 on foot as a small child. \n        \u201cIt definitely shapes one\u2019s essence,\u201d she says of the Holocaust. \u201cYou\u2019re familiar with the possibility of horror.\u201d Hauptman still remembers the final fearful moments of her escape.\n        \u201cTwo Nazi officers were walking towards us,\u201d she recalls. The family was just a few miles from safety, from the chunk of Italy occupied by the Allies. \u201cThey said, \u2018Heil Hitler!\u2019 and we raised our hands. They kept walking, and we kept walking. Just a few feet past, there was a Madonna. We dropped to the ground and prayed in case they would turn around and take a look.\u201d \n        The Holocaust was the largest loss of Jewish life in their long history of persecution and pogroms. October 7, 2023, is now the deadliest day for Jews since then.\n        \u201cLet\u2019s get any airline that goes anywhere!\u201d was the conversation Hauptman had with her own daughter that morning. \u201cAnd when we got on that plane it already felt like, \u2018All right let\u2019s go!\u2019 And then they started selling seats, upgrades! And we thought, \u2018Just go, just go!\u2019\u201d\n        Charlotte Hauptman was in Israel this fall on a side-trip. The main event of her travels was a wedding in Italy. The bride, Myriam Lanternari, is the great-granddaughter of an Italian couple, Virgilio and Daria Virgili, who Hauptman credits with saving her life and the lives of  her parents more than 80 years ago, sheltering them from the Nazis in a little village called Secchiano.\n        \u201cHe took us into his home. They gave us food. They gave us shelter,\u201d Hauptman said. \u201cI knew not to talk to any German. And they came in the village.\u201d The Nazis had a garrison nearby. \n        \u201cI remember leaflets being dropped from airplanes, German airplanes, warning the people if you help Jews or Partisans that\u2019s the end of you,\u201d Hauptman said. \u201cNo one ever outed us. They stayed protecting us.\u201d\n        The villagers concocted a story just in case any Germans started asking questions, Hauptman recalls. Her parents, Wolf and Esther, would be deaf mutes working in the field. And Charlotte would just lose herself in the clique of kids playing in the street.\n        \u201cI knew that our lives were in danger,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then when things lightened up, I was able to be a child. And the Italian people were helpful in letting me have that. I always felt loved. My parents. The villagers. It was always a very warm feeling.\u201d\n        There was another Jewish family living in nearby Cagli, close to a German garrison. The two families would meet up from time to time.\n        \u201cI know that at some point we couldn\u2019t visit them anymore,\u201d says Hauptman. \u201cBecause they were taken and killed.\u201d\n        After allied British troops landed in Italy, the Germans became even more skittish and suspicious.\n        \u201cThe village became more dangerous, if that\u2019s even possible,\u201d says Hauptman. \u201cVirgilio Virgili decided to take us to the occupied zone where the Allies already were.\u201d \n        Virgilio and his young daughter Mercedes walked Charlotte and her family to safety. The Italian father and daughter were with the fleeing Jewish family when they all fell to their knees in front of that Madonna, just miles from safety, pretending to be nothing more than a gaggle of good Italian Catholics. It worked.  \n        But when Virgilio and Mercedes returned to the village, he was arrested. \u201cVirgilio was nabbed by the Nazis, held for days, and tortured,\u201d Hauptman said. And Mercedes was with her father when the Nazis arrived. \u201cThey came and grabbed him and threw him in a Jeep and she was crying and holding on as the Jeep was leaving and they kept hitting her on her hands to let go.\u201d He never confessed and was eventually released.\n        Charlotte Hauptman and Mercedes Virgili remained lifelong friends. Their children are friends. Their grandchildren are friends.\n        \u201cI was born November 25, 1938, right in the middle of it,\u201d says Hauptman, matter-of-factly.\n        The future looked so bleak that her mother, Esther Fullenbaum, thought she should abort her baby. She didn\u2019t. And would soon credit Charlotte with saving her life. By making her faint at just the right time.\n        The story became part of family lore. The Gestapo, Nazi Germany\u2019s secret police, were rounding up Jews in Hanover where the family lived. Esther, heavily pregnant, was at her sister\u2019s apartment when officers knocked at the door. Esther fainted, so the Gestapo left her behind. But she would never see her sister or brother-in-law again. They were murdered in the camps.\n        Esther fled to Milan, where her husband Wolf was working at the time. \u201cI was born 10 days after she arrived,\u201d adds Hauptman.\n        The family lived there until Italy\u2019s Jews were rounded up and taken to concentration camps. The Fullenbaums were taken to one in Calabria, in southern Italy. When that camp became too crowded, they were sent to live with a family near Venice.\n        They had to check in with the police once a week. They were under curfew. And fear rose in Charlotte. \u201cI remember being under the table one night crying,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother asked why I was crying, and I said, \u2018Because you will both die and I will be alone.\u2019\u201d\n        Italian police officers soon came with a warning. \u201cThey said tomorrow you\u2019re due to be picked up and sent to Auschwitz. So, you better leave now, before curfew and disappear.\u201d\n        Years later, the family found the telegram, sent the next day by the Italian police to their German overlords, which ends: \u201cTHEY WERE NOT THERE. DESTINATION UNKNOWN.\u201d\n        From that point on, Charlotte \u2013 little more than a toddler \u2013 was on the run with her parents, protected by the Partisans, who eventually took her family to Secchiano and the Virgilis.\n        \u201cThis story is not just my story, it\u2019s their story,\u201d says Hauptman. Her parents spent what little money they had buying food, usually from the village miller\u2019s wife. Until they ran out of money. But the miller\u2019s wife had a solution. In exchange for the wedding band on Esther\u2019s finger, the family could have all the food they would ever need. \u201cShe was saving my mother\u2019s honor,\u201d says Hauptman. \u201cSo, she could feel comfortable getting the food.\u201d\n        Years later, while living in Los Angeles, Hauptman got a call from an Italian American couple from San Francisco. They had just spent their honeymoon in Secchiano and had met the miller\u2019s son. He\u2019d given them the ring and asked them to find its rightful owner in America. Hauptman wore the ring as she spoke to CNN.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know how they found us in LA, but they did\u2026 that\u2019s the Italians!\u201d\n        After the Virgili family wedding in Italy, Hauptman and her daughter, Michele Goldman, flew straight to Israel.\n        \u201cShe and I had talked about it years ago. We should do this mother and daughter trip,\u201d Hauptman said. \u201cWe thought it would be a good bonding experience.\u201d And it was, until the terror began, and she once again had to flee for her life.\n        Hamas terrorists crossed the border from Gaza into Israel, where they slaughtered 1,400 Israelis and took between 100 and 200 people back to Gaza as hostages. The IDF is now hitting Hamas hard in Gaza, and more than 4,000 Palestinians have now also been killed. \n        \u201cWe were sitting having breakfast in the hotel. We had made reservations for a tour to Bethlehem and Jerusalem,\u201d said Hauptman. \u201cSuddenly the alarms went off and I just looked at the faces of the locals and I read their faces. Panic.\u201d\n        Her daughter, Hauptman would later find out, was panicking on the inside. \u201cShe lost her husband five years ago when her boys were still young and she told me later that all she kept thinking was, \u2018Please don\u2019t let my boys lose another parent.\u2019\u201d\n        Even now, and even here, in tranquil Southern California, Hauptman says she never feels totally safe. \u201cAntisemitism is always there. It goes undercover for a while and then the opportunity arises. It\u2019s a cyclical thing,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t fool yourself. We\u2019re sitting here now. In an hour, it can be different.\u201d\n        \u201cNever Again,\u201d is a slogan about the Holocaust that Hauptman says gets a lot of lip service. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dream,\u201d says Hauptman. And she is not hopeful of an imminent peace in the Middle East. \u201cAs long as there are people who want Israel annihilated and the Jews to disappear,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine it.\u201d\n        Hauptman also can\u2019t imagine returning to Israel. Not yet. \u201cBut I do want to get over this enough,\u201d she says. \u201cEnough to go back.\u201d\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/us/holocaust-survivor-israel/index.html", "section": "us"}

Emerson, 44, has been charged in federal court with interfering with a flight crew, the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Oregon announced Tuesday. That charge comes on the heels of dozens of state charges in Oregon, including 83 felony counts of attempted murder, 83 counts of reckless endangerment and one count of endangering an aircraft, booking records show. \n        Emerson attempted to cut fuel to the plane\u2019s engines while the flight was en route from Washington state to San Francisco on Sunday, according to authorities. But it was the quick action of the aircraft\u2019s captain and first officer that kept the engines from failing completely, the airline said. \n        Emerson was subdued by members of the flight crew but then attempted to grab the handle of an emergency exit during the flight\u2019s descent, according to a release from the US attorney\u2019s office. \n        The flight was forced to divert to Portland, Oregon, where the suspect was taken into custody by Port of Portland police, the agency said in a statement.\n        While in custody, Emerson told a police officer he became depressed about six months ago, according to an affidavit authored by an FBI agent and included alongside the federal complaint. Emerson denied taking any medications, the affidavit says, but he did discuss psychedelic mushrooms with the responding officer.\n        \u201cThe officer and Emerson talked about the use of psychedelic mushrooms and Emerson said it was his first-time taking mushrooms,\u201d the affidavit says.\n        Asked specifically if Emerson told officers he had been under the influence of mushrooms at the time of the incident, a spokesperson for the US Attorney\u2019s Office in Oregon told CNN that remains part of their ongoing investigation.\n        While in custody, Emerson said he was \u201cadmitting to what I did,\u201d per the affidavit. \u201cI\u2019m not fighting any charges you want to bring against me, guys,\u201d he said. \n        Emerson is being held without bail at the Multnomah County Jail and is expected in court on the state charges Tuesday afternoon. Online records do not list an attorney for Emerson, and CNN has been working to determine if he has legal representation in both state and federal court.\n        Authorities do not believe the incident was an act of terrorism or ideologically motivated violence, a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN. Investigators believe it may have been the result of a mental health episode, and authorities are preparing for court officials to order an assessment of the defendant\u2019s psychological state as part of court proceedings, the source said.\n        Here\u2019s what we know.  \n        After taking off from Everett, Washington, on Sunday, Alaska Airlines Flight 2059 \u2013 operated by regional carrier Horizon Air \u2013 reported a \u201csecurity threat related to an off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot, identified as Captain Joseph Emerson, who was traveling in the flight deck jump seat,\u201d the airline said in a statement. \n        Pilots will sometimes ride in a cockpit \u201cjump seat\u201d when traveling in their official capacity or commuting between airports. \n        While in the cockpit, Emerson had tried to shut down both of the Embraer 175\u2019s engines by pulling its fire extinguisher handles, the airline said. \n        \u201cThe fire suppression system consists of a T-handle for each engine; when pulled, a valve in the wing closes to shut off fuel to the engine,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a statement to CNN. \u201cAfter they are pulled, some residual fuel remains in the line.\u201d \n        The airline said the quick reaction of the crew to reset both handles helped restore the flow of fuel and prevented the engines from cutting out. \n        \u201cOur crew responded without hesitation to a difficult and highly unusual situation, and we are incredibly proud and grateful for their skillful actions,\u201d the airline said in a statement. \n        Emerson initially engaged the pilots in small talk about the weather and the aircraft, the affidavit says. He then said, \u201cI\u2019m not OK,\u201d and one of the pilots turned around to see him reaching up and grabbing the red fire handles, the affidavit says. \n        One of the pilots grabbed Emerson\u2019s wrist while the other declared an inflight emergency, the affidavit says. One pilot said Emerson \u201cinitially resisted,\u201d and the two \u201cwrestled\u201d for about half a minute before Emerson agreed to leave the cockpit. \n        \u201cI think he\u2019s subdued,\u201d one of the plane\u2019s pilots can be heard saying in air traffic control audio recorded by LiveATC.net. \u201cOther than that, we want law enforcement as soon as we get on the ground and are parked.\u201d\n        After \u201cpeacefully walking to the back of the plane,\u201d the affidavit says Emerson told a flight attendant, \u201cYou need to cuff me right now or it\u2019s going to be bad.\u201d \n        The crew cuffed his wrists, but during the descent, Emerson \u201cturned towards an emergency exit door and tried to grab the handle,\u201d and was stopped by a flight attendant, the affidavit says. \n        \u201cAnother flight attendant observed Emerson make statements such as, \u2018I messed everything up\u2019 and that \u2018he tried to kill everybody,\u2019\u201d the affidavit says. \u201cEmerson was heard saying he had just put 84 peoples\u2019 lives at risk tonight including his own.\u201d\n        When the flight landed at Portland International Airport around 6:30 p.m., the suspect was taken into custody by Port of Portland police officers, the port said. \n        No injuries were reported on the flight, the FBI said.\n        All passengers were later able to fly to San Francisco with a new crew and aircraft, the airline said, noting it is \u201creaching out to each of them individually to discuss their experience and check-in on their well-being.\u201d\n        The FBI and the Port of Portland police are investigating the incident, authorities said. \n        The FBI\u2019s Portland field office confirmed its investigation in a statement Monday and assured travelers there is \u201cno continuing threat related to this incident.\u201d \n        The Federal Aviation Administration also said it is supporting local law enforcement in the investigation. \n        The FAA said it has briefed other airlines on preliminary details of the incident and informed carriers the incident is not related to \u201ccurrent world events\u201d \u2013 apparently referring to the war in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas.  \n        Two passengers on the flight told CNN that the airline crew maintained a calm environment on the plane as the incident played out. \n        Aubrey Gavello, one of the passengers, said she didn\u2019t realize something was wrong until a flight attendant announced over the loudspeaker that the plane needed to land immediately.\n        \u201cWe didn\u2019t know where we were landing, and we didn\u2019t know what was wrong. But (the flight attendant) assured us we were safe,\u201d Gavello said on CNN\u2019s \u201cLaura Coates Live\u201d on Monday night. \n        Later, the pilot informed passengers through the loudspeaker that there had been a \u201cdisturbance in the cockpit,\u201d said Alex Wood, who was seated at the front of the plane. Wood said he was wearing headphones and slept through the incident. \n        \u201cI was right by the cockpit, but nothing woke me up. Nothing was loud enough, nothing was rambunctious enough to wake me up,\u201d Wood said. \n        About five police officers boarded the plane after it landed and escorted the suspect off the aircraft, Gavello recalled. She noted he was calm and cooperative and had his hands secured by zip ties. \n        After Emerson was taken off the plane, a flight attendant announced on the loudspeaker that \u201che had a mental breakdown,\u201d Gavello told CNN affiliate KGO.\n        \u201cProps to the Alaska crew for keeping everyone calm,\u201d Gavello told CNN. \n        \u201cIt was all handled super well,\u201d said Wood.\n        The pair said they didn\u2019t realize the gravity of the situation Monday, when they woke to news headlines about the suspect trying to shut down the plane engines. \n        \u201cI\u2019m honestly grateful that we didn\u2019t know anything when they rebooked us and got us on a second plane,\u201d Gavello said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would have felt comfortable doing that if we had all the information.\u201d\n        Emerson\u2019s neighbor, Ed Yee, told CNN it was \u201cvery shocking\u201d to hear of the suspect\u2019s alleged actions. \n        \u201cHe seems like a really nice guy. Nothing abnormal about him,\u201d Yee said.\n        Emerson had his most recent FAA medical examination last month, records show. He has a first-class medical certificate, the highest level of medical certificate awarded by the agency, which requires examinations every six months for pilots 40 and over.\n        Emerson has worked in aviation for at least two decades, according to information shared by Alaska Airlines. \n        He first joined the Alaska Air Group in 2001 as a first officer with Horizon. In 2012, Emerson left Horizon and joined Virgin America as a pilot. \n        After Alaska Airlines acquired Virgin America in 2016, Emerson became a first officer with Alaska and worked about three more years to become a pilot for the airline, according to the airline statement.\n        \u201cThroughout his career, Emerson completed his mandated FAA medical certifications in accordance with regulatory requirements, and at no point were his certifications denied, suspended or revoked,\u201d Alaska Airlines said in a statement. \n        FAA records show Emerson held an Airline Transport Pilot certification with ratings to fly the Airbus A320, Boeing 737, Canadair Regional Jet, and De Havilland Dash 8. He did not hold a certification to fly the ERJ 175, those records indicate, the type of airplane in use during Sunday\u2019s incident.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/us/alaska-airlines-disruption-off-duty-pilot-tuesday/index.html", "section": "us"}

Du Bois \u2013 both members of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. \u2013 lead the movement for racial justice in the United States.  \n        Today, the Divine Nine organizations boast hundreds of chapters across the US and around the world. Traditions such as stepping, which is a blend of African traditional movements and American dance styles, are often associated with Divine Nine organizations. \n        But they have also maintained their commitment to philanthropy and service through scholarships, community service and programs to develop their members personally and professionally.\n        \u201cWe\u2019re usually the first people that people turn to for help,\u201d Ross said, adding that Divine Nine organizations play a central role in the Black community and often provide mentorship and guidance to the next generation.  \n        There is also an exclusivity of who adorns the letters, the organizations say. To even be considered for membership, there are certain academic and community service requirements that must be met along with commitment to upholding moral character. \n        \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of dedication that goes with becoming a member \u2026 You\u2019re pledging yourself to work on behalf of your community with those representing something larger than yourself. And it takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice to do so.\u201d\n        Black Greek-letter organizations distinguish themselves with colors, calls and letters. And, as a show of pride and to signify their membership, those in the organizations wear clothing and items bearing their Greek symbols also known as \u201cparaphernalia.\u201d  \n        Ross told CNN it is even included in the organizations\u2019 protocols that their paraphernalia is only to be worn by duly initiated members and there are rules around when and where to be dressed in the letters.\n        According to CNN affiliate WTVF, the Nashville teacher at the center of controversy around the second grade student\u2019s AKA t-shirt, also sent an email to the child\u2019s mom explaining that, \u201cAKA branded items are trademarked and reserved for members only.\u201d \n        While some Divine Nine members on social media said they understood the teacher\u2019s actions because the child should not have been wearing the shirt, others disagreed and said the teacher went a step too far by removing a 7-year-old\u2019s clothes.\n        Other recent incidents of people who are not members wearing paraphernalia or using hand signs have also sparked anger and backlash among some members.   \n        Actress Amanda Seales faced criticism in 2021 for wearing the AKA letters in an episode of  the television series \u201cInsecure.\u201d Though her character was described as a member of the organization, Seales was criticized by some on social media for wearing the sorority\u2019s letters because she herself was not a member.  \n        Rapper Boosie BadAzz has also faced online backlash for wearing Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., paraphernalia and apologized in 2020 after he posted pictures in the fraternity\u2019s t-shirt. \n        Ross encourages people to research and learn more about Divine Nine sorority and fraternity culture. But, he said, once a person is aware, they should be respectful of the organizations\u2019 cultures and traditions. \n        \u201cAll of these things are culturally relevant, you should listen to understand,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t understand what our devotion is and has been in the Black community \u2026 without understanding the Divine Nine.\u201d\n        For Divine Nine sororities and fraternities, membership doesn\u2019t end once a person graduates from college, it can be extended through graduate school chapters and lasts for a lifetime.  \n        \u201cMembership continues because that\u2019s our connection to our greater goal,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford a localized college experience. Our college experience has to be able to go back into the community, has to go back into our family, has to go back and lift the people who were not able to go to college or aspire to go to college, or their kids aspire to go to college.\u201d  \n        Some of the organizations also extend honorary membership to those who have excelled significantly in their careers or made notable contributions to society. In July, US Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson became an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.\n        Together, members celebrate each other\u2019s milestones, such as graduations and weddings, with songs and chants. Members are also eulogized in memorial services after their death.   \n        \u201cThe lifelong bond is built through lifelong service,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWe are in the experience business and because we all have experiences that impact our lives, that bond never goes away.\u201d\n  Disclaimer: Chandelis Duster is a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.

And many victims sought medical help on their own, authorities said. \n        Meteorologists earlier said \u201csuper fog\u201d had heavily impacted the area, just west of New Orleans, around the time of the pileups. Super fog is a thick fog that develops in damp, smoky conditions and can send visibilities plummeting to less than 10 feet, according to the National Weather Service.\n        Some of the vehicles caught on fire after the initial crash, authorities said. One of the vehicles involved in the wrecks was a tanker truck carrying \u201chazardous liquid,\u201d police said without elaborating on the substance.\n        Police were working Monday evening to move the truck due to a \u201ccompromised tank/trailer.\u201d\n        \u201cOnce the tanker is removed, first responders will be able to better assess the vehicles in that immediate area. It is possible that additional fatalities could be located,\u201d state police added.\n        Authorities have asked the public to reach out if they have a missing family member who was traveling through the area Monday morning. \n        Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said he was praying for those killed and wounded in the crashes. \n        \u201cThe combination of wildfire smoke and dense fog is dangerous, and I want to encourage all Louisianans in affected areas to take extreme caution while traveling,\u201d Edwards said on X, formerly known as Twitter. \n        \u201cI also want to thank the first responders and medical personnel who have worked so diligently to save lives and render aid,\u201d the governor added. \u201cThe best way you can help them, besides exercising caution on the road, is to donate blood at your local blood donation center. It will help replenish supplies that are being drained today to care for the wounded.\u201d\n        Earlier, St. John the Baptist Parish Sheriff Mike Tregre told CNN affiliate WVUE about three 18-wheel trucks collided in the northbound lanes and were fully engulfed in flames. In the southbound lanes, there were two reported multi-car pileups, one of which was also producing flames.\n        According to Tregre, all first responders had to be on foot because the crashes left the area \u201ccompletely gridlocked.\u201d \n        \u201cThe situation is pretty bad,\u201d he added.\n        Visibility levels were below a quarter mile at a nearby weather station from just after 4 a.m. CDT until just before 10 a.m. CDT. Visibility likely neared zero at times throughout the morning when the fog was at its densest.\n        The incredibly dense fog, known as \u201csuper fog,\u201d was caused by fog combining with smoke from nearby fires. \n        Louisiana has battled unprecedented wildfires, extreme heat and relentless drought since the summer. Exceptional drought, the highest category tracked by the US Drought Monitor, is in place across 62% of the state. \n        In a statement Monday, the city of New Orleans said it is monitoring an active fire burning underground in forested wetlands between Bayou Sauvage National Urban Wildlife Refuge and the Michoud Canal.\n        The lack of rain combined with the summer\u2019s extreme heat dried out wetlands and reduced the water table\u2019s depth, the city said. The blaze being monitored has been burning at and below surface level, it added. \n        A repeat of Monday\u2019s super fog is unlikely for Tuesday morning as \u201cwinds should be much stronger,\u201d the National Weather Service in New Orleans said Monday on X, previously known as Twitter. Winds need to be calm or very light in order for dense fog to form.\n        Patchy areas of dense fog may be possible but will not be as widespread as Monday, the city said, citing the weather service.\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/us/louisiana-fog-i55-crash-new-orleans/index.html", "section": "us"}

She was never scared. She would have run through the vault if she had to,\u201d Alexin said.    \n        On the evening of February 22, T\u2019Yonna should have been at the Orlando Metro Gymnastics gym, where she never missed a practice. But a stranger with a gun went on a shooting spree in Orange County, Florida, first killing 38-year-old Nathacha Augustin and then 24-year-old Dylan Lyons, who was covering the story for CNN affiliate Spectrum News 13. The gunman then walked into T\u2019Yonna\u2019s home at random and shot her and her mother. T\u2019Yonna was killed. \n        From the time T\u2019Yonna\u2019s parents, Brandi and Tokiyo Major, brought her home from the hospital, they knew she was going places \u2013 literally.   \n        \u201cShe was walking at the age of eight months,\u201d Brandi said. That\u2019s months earlier than the one-year mark when many babies start walking. \u201cShe skipped crawling. She used to scoot around on her butt and went straight to walking.\u201d \n        \u201cI just knew she was gonna be something.\u201d      \n        By age 3, she was tumbling around everywhere, jumping and flipping, Brandi said.     \n        Brandi and Tokiyo signed her up for gymnastics, and her world opened up. The whole family could see she was a natural, T\u2019Yonna\u2019s uncle, Dominic Major, said.      \n        \u201cI remember, when I came down to visit from Chicago, we were at my mother\u2019s house. She started climbing on the table and flipping. It was like, \u2018Oh my God. She\u2019s a little gymnast,\u2019\u201d Dominic said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what she was.\u201d   \n        Two gymnastics classes a week weren\u2019t enough for T\u2019Yonna, so Brandi and Tokiyo got the equipment she needed to practice at home. \n  Read other profiles of children who\u2019ve died from gunfire      \u201cShe ate gymnastics. She slept it. She\u2019d wake up in the morning, hit the bars, the balance beam,\u201d Tokiyo said. She would practice her routines so many times that the whole family knew them by heart.\n        T\u2019Yonna applied that drive to everything she did in life. She didn\u2019t just like to help her parents out in the kitchen, she was going to be a professional chef. She didn\u2019t just enjoy reading, she devoured over 100 books last year.   \n        The \u201cDiary of a Wimpy Kid\u201d series was one of her favorites. Tokiyo read T\u2019Yonna to sleep every night, and because Brandi worked nights, T\u2019Yonna would read her mom to sleep.  \n        T\u2019Yonna is one of more than 1,300 children and teens killed by a gun so far in 2023, according to the Gun Violence Archive. Firearms became the No. 1 killer of children and teens in America in 2020, surpassing motor vehicle accidents, which had long been the leading cause of death among America\u2019s youth. \n        The man who is charged with killing T\u2019Yonna, then 19-year-old Keith Moses, is facing three counts of first-degree murder, among other charges, for the crimes he committed on the day of the shooting. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n        Police haven\u2019t said whether there was a motive for the shooting.\n        On what would have been T\u2019Yonna\u2019s first day of fourth grade, Yaya\u2019s Dream Foundation, the nonprofit T\u2019Yonna\u2019s family founded shortly after her death, gave out 100 book bags filled with essential supplies at the elementary school she attended.   \n        The services the group provides are meant to capture the spirit of T\u2019Yonna\u2019s generosity \u2013 the way she would lay her toys out for other kids in the neighborhood to take once she had outgrown them, watching with excitement as they found new homes, or how she insisted her parents keep a second bicycle at the house, so any friend who came over to spend the night could ride one too.\n        The foundation also advocates for more responsible gun laws, to reduce violence in the community.   \n        \u201cWe\u2019re trying to\u2026 We\u2019re going to \u2013 there ain\u2019t no trying \u2013 we\u2019re going to keep her name going,\u201d Tokiyo said.     \n        \u201cEvery day that she was here, it was just a good memory,\u201d he said. But the Mondays and Wednesdays that Tokiyo took T\u2019Yonna to gymnastics practice were especially good memories.  \n        \u201cCoaches aren\u2019t supposed to have favorites, but there was just something really special about her,\u201d Alexin said.      \n        If there was a trick she had yet to nail, T\u2019Yonna would ask Alexin for feedback, and then she\u2019d practice it over, and over and over again until she nailed it. When she learned that college scholarships existed for gymnastic athletes, she was determined to get one.      \n        \u201cI told her every day, you\u2019re going to do NCAA gymnastics someday,\u201d Alexin said.    \n        She studied videos of the pros doing gymnastics \u2013 Gabby Douglas, Simone Biles \u2013 she memorized their movements, their tricks and tics.      \n        Tokiyo said they must have watched the \u201cGabby Douglas Story\u201d a million times.      \n        \u201cYeah, we watched that movie a lot,\u201d Brandi said.   \n  Gun violence is an epidemic in the US. Here are 4 things you can do today      It wasn\u2019t just the household names. T\u2019Yonna studied videos of gymnasts who were winning medals at every level, including Soraya Hawthorne, one of the gymnasts Alexin trained. T\u2019Yonna studied videos of her competing and took note of how Soraya would tap her heart and point to the sky when she would compete, as a tribute to her father, Alexin said.  \n        It wasn\u2019t long before T\u2019Yonna started earning her own medals \u2013 24 in just two years.     \n        \u201cWhen I\u2019d get there and I\u2019d see what she does, I\u2019d just be so floored,\u201d Brandi said. \u201cLook at my baby.\u201d      \n        But it wasn\u2019t enough for T\u2019Yonna to win on her own. \n        \u201cThere were nine other little girls on the team, and they all looked up to her,\u201d Alexin said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t name a captain, but she was the captain.\u201d     \n        One of T\u2019Yonna\u2019s teammates, 9-year-old McKenna, said T\u2019Yonna was the best gymnast on the team.  \n        \u201cShe was the first one to get her back handspring on floor,\u201d McKenna said.    \n        T\u2019Yonna was serious when it came to competing, but even at competitions, she was always having a good time.   \n        \u201cShe would dance around in line when we were waiting to compete,\u201d McKenna said.    \n        T\u2019Yonna loved unicorns. Now the girls share a stuffed unicorn, clad with a little leotard, in her memory.  \n        \u201cCaptain, fearless, kind\u2026best teammate ever.\u201d   \n        The other young gymnasts on T\u2019Yonna\u2019s team gathered after they lost her and called out characteristics that T\u2019Yonna brought to the sport. They decided that when one of the girls excelled \u2013 when they were brave, or strong or determined, the way T\u2019Yonna was \u2014 Alexin would award them a \u201cT-point.\u201d   \n        A couple of weeks later, Alexin offered the girls the chance to redeem their points for prizes. They unanimously decided they would rather have the T-points\n        \u201cThose T-points had meaning to them greater than some prize,\u201d Alexin said.    \n        Now, Alexin says, when one of the girls sticks a landing, they take a moment, tap their heart and point up to T\u2019Yonna.  \n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/us/tyonna-major-us-gun-deaths-gdpr/index.html", "section": "us"}

The family was just a few miles from safety, from the chunk of Italy occupied by the Allies. \u201cThey said, \u2018Heil Hitler!\u2019 and we raised our hands. They kept walking, and we kept walking. Just a few feet past, there was a Madonna. We dropped to the ground and prayed in case they would turn around and take a look.\u201d \n        The Holocaust was the largest loss of Jewish life in their long history of persecution and pogroms. October 7, 2023, is now the deadliest day for Jews since then.\n        \u201cLet\u2019s get any airline that goes anywhere!\u201d was the conversation Hauptman had with her own daughter that morning. \u201cAnd when we got on that plane it already felt like, \u2018All right let\u2019s go!\u2019 And then they started selling seats, upgrades! And we thought, \u2018Just go, just go!\u2019\u201d\n        Charlotte Hauptman was in Israel this fall on a side-trip. The main event of her travels was a wedding in Italy. The bride, Myriam Lanternari, is the great-granddaughter of an Italian couple, Virgilio and Daria Virgili, who Hauptman credits with saving her life and the lives of  her parents more than 80 years ago, sheltering them from the Nazis in a little village called Secchiano.\n        \u201cHe took us into his home. They gave us food. They gave us shelter,\u201d Hauptman said. \u201cI knew not to talk to any German. And they came in the village.\u201d The Nazis had a garrison nearby. \n        \u201cI remember leaflets being dropped from airplanes, German airplanes, warning the people if you help Jews or Partisans that\u2019s the end of you,\u201d Hauptman said. \u201cNo one ever outed us. They stayed protecting us.\u201d\n        The villagers concocted a story just in case any Germans started asking questions, Hauptman recalls. Her parents, Wolf and Esther, would be deaf mutes working in the field. And Charlotte would just lose herself in the clique of kids playing in the street.\n        \u201cI knew that our lives were in danger,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then when things lightened up, I was able to be a child. And the Italian people were helpful in letting me have that. I always felt loved. My parents. The villagers. It was always a very warm feeling.\u201d\n        There was another Jewish family living in nearby Cagli, close to a German garrison. The two families would meet up from time to time.\n        \u201cI know that at some point we couldn\u2019t visit them anymore,\u201d says Hauptman. \u201cBecause they were taken and killed.\u201d\n        After allied British troops landed in Italy, the Germans became even more skittish and suspicious.\n        \u201cThe village became more dangerous, if that\u2019s even possible,\u201d says Hauptman. \u201cVirgilio Virgili decided to take us to the occupied zone where the Allies already were.\u201d \n        Virgilio and his young daughter Mercedes walked Charlotte and her family to safety. The Italian father and daughter were with the fleeing Jewish family when they all fell to their knees in front of that Madonna, just miles from safety, pretending to be nothing more than a gaggle of good Italian Catholics. It worked.  \n        But when Virgilio and Mercedes returned to the village, he was arrested. \u201cVirgilio was nabbed by the Nazis, held for days, and tortured,\u201d Hauptman said. And Mercedes was with her father when the Nazis arrived. \u201cThey came and grabbed him and threw him in a Jeep and she was crying and holding on as the Jeep was leaving and they kept hitting her on her hands to let go.\u201d He never confessed and was eventually released.\n        Charlotte Hauptman and Mercedes Virgili remained lifelong friends. Their children are friends. Their grandchildren are friends.\n        \u201cI was born November 25, 1938, right in the middle of it,\u201d says Hauptman, matter-of-factly.\n        The future looked so bleak that her mother, Esther Fullenbaum, thought she should abort her baby. She didn\u2019t. And would soon credit Charlotte with saving her life. By making her faint at just the right time.\n        The story became part of family lore. The Gestapo, Nazi Germany\u2019s secret police, were rounding up Jews in Hanover where the family lived. Esther, heavily pregnant, was at her sister\u2019s apartment when officers knocked at the door. Esther fainted, so the Gestapo left her behind. But she would never see her sister or brother-in-law again. They were murdered in the camps.\n        Esther fled to Milan, where her husband Wolf was working at the time. \u201cI was born 10 days after she arrived,\u201d adds Hauptman.\n        The family lived there until Italy\u2019s Jews were rounded up and taken to concentration camps. The Fullenbaums were taken to one in Calabria, in southern Italy. When that camp became too crowded, they were sent to live with a family near Venice.\n        They had to check in with the police once a week. They were under curfew. And fear rose in Charlotte. \u201cI remember being under the table one night crying,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother asked why I was crying, and I said, \u2018Because you will both die and I will be alone.\u2019\u201d\n        Italian police officers soon came with a warning. \u201cThey said tomorrow you\u2019re due to be picked up and sent to Auschwitz. So, you better leave now, before curfew and disappear.\u201d\n        Years later, the family found the telegram, sent the next day by the Italian police to their German overlords, which ends: \u201cTHEY WERE NOT THERE. DESTINATION UNKNOWN.\u201d\n        From that point on, Charlotte \u2013 little more than a toddler \u2013 was on the run with her parents, protected by the Partisans, who eventually took her family to Secchiano and the Virgilis.\n        \u201cThis story is not just my story, it\u2019s their story,\u201d says Hauptman. Her parents spent what little money they had buying food, usually from the village miller\u2019s wife. Until they ran out of money. But the miller\u2019s wife had a solution. In exchange for the wedding band on Esther\u2019s finger, the family could have all the food they would ever need. \u201cShe was saving my mother\u2019s honor,\u201d says Hauptman. \u201cSo, she could feel comfortable getting the food.\u201d\n        Years later, while living in Los Angeles, Hauptman got a call from an Italian American couple from San Francisco. They had just spent their honeymoon in Secchiano and had met the miller\u2019s son. He\u2019d given them the ring and asked them to find its rightful owner in America. Hauptman wore the ring as she spoke to CNN.\n        \u201cI don\u2019t know how they found us in LA, but they did\u2026 that\u2019s the Italians!\u201d\n        After the Virgili family wedding in Italy, Hauptman and her daughter, Michele Goldman, flew straight to Israel.\n        \u201cShe and I had talked about it years ago. We should do this mother and daughter trip,\u201d Hauptman said. \u201cWe thought it would be a good bonding experience.\u201d And it was, until the terror began, and she once again had to flee for her life.\n        Hamas terrorists crossed the border from Gaza into Israel, where they slaughtered 1,400 Israelis and took between 100 and 200 people back to Gaza as hostages. The IDF is now hitting Hamas hard in Gaza, and more than 4,000 Palestinians have now also been killed. \n        \u201cWe were sitting having breakfast in the hotel. We had made reservations for a tour to Bethlehem and Jerusalem,\u201d said Hauptman. \u201cSuddenly the alarms went off and I just looked at the faces of the locals and I read their faces. Panic.\u201d\n        Her daughter, Hauptman would later find out, was panicking on the inside. \u201cShe lost her husband five years ago when her boys were still young and she told me later that all she kept thinking was, \u2018Please don\u2019t let my boys lose another parent.\u2019\u201d\n        Even now, and even here, in tranquil Southern California, Hauptman says she never feels totally safe. \u201cAntisemitism is always there. It goes undercover for a while and then the opportunity arises. It\u2019s a cyclical thing,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t fool yourself. We\u2019re sitting here now. In an hour, it can be different.\u201d\n        \u201cNever Again,\u201d is a slogan about the Holocaust that Hauptman says gets a lot of lip service. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dream,\u201d says Hauptman. And she is not hopeful of an imminent peace in the Middle East. \u201cAs long as there are people who want Israel annihilated and the Jews to disappear,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine it.\u201d\n        Hauptman also can\u2019t imagine returning to Israel. Not yet. \u201cBut I do want to get over this enough,\u201d she says. \u201cEnough to go back.\u201d\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/us/holocaust-survivor-israel/index.html", "section": "us"}
