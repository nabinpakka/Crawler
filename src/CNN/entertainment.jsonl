Yet he appears to remain in denial about changes in the movie business that he loves, and the fact that with his last two films, \u201cThe Irishman\u201d and \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d he has graduated to directing what are, for all intents and purposes, limited series for streaming.\n  ", "body": "      Scorsese made headlines in 2019 when he stated in an interview that Marvel movies were \u201cnot cinema\u201d in terms of providing \u201caesthetic, emotional and spiritual revelation,\u201d as he later explained the idea in an op-ed for the New York Times. \n        The director also acknowledged in that article he understood the shift that had taken place, lamenting that multiplexes were \u201ccrowded with franchise pictures.\u201d While expressing gratitude that Netflix had allowed him to make \u201cThe Irishman\u201d the way he wanted to, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know a single filmmaker who doesn\u2019t want to design films for the big screen, to be projected before audiences in theaters.\u201d\n        Still, Scorsese is operating under an old set of rules governing Hollywood, including the one that says, to borrow from an even older adage, when you take the king\u2019s money, you give the king his due.\n        In this case, Scorsese has taken money from streaming service \u2013 first Netflix, now Apple TV+ \u2013 that allowed him to make 3 \u00bd-hour historical dramas that, let\u2019s face it, would have struggled to find enough theatrical patronage to justify the investment in our current times, the outlier of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d notwithstanding. For starters, any studio preoccupied with box office, as opposed to streaming, would have asked, if not insisted, that the 207-minute running time be cut substantially.\n        What that means, practically, is that after a wider and longer-than-usual theatrical run for awards consideration \u2013 the prestige from that being a primary factor in why Netflix and now Apple wrote those checks \u2013 \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d will be available on its platform (with a potential boost after nominations are announced) to consume at home.\n        Running roughly the length of a four-part limited series, most will watch the historical drama in that fashion with interruptions and bathroom breaks, just not those devised by the filmmaker.\n        Does that degrade or disparage these films in any way? Certainly not as entertainment, and arguably, the limited series has become a haven for some of the most creative storytelling put on screens, whatever their size, in the last decade.\n        What it does reflect is that Scorsese\u2019s view of what constitutes \u201ccinema\u201d has an outdated ring to it as many distinctions between TV and movies have evolved and indeed faded \u2013 a dynamic hastened by the twin phenomena of streaming and a global pandemic.\n        Other directors, notably, have embraced the unfettered time that streaming offers, from Zack Snyder\u2019s four-hour vision of \u201cJustice League\u201d to Baz Luhrmann\u2019s upcoming \u201cFaraway Downs,\u201d which expands and reimagines his 2008 movie \u201cAustralia,\u201d starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman, into a six-episode series with a different ending. The latter premieres on Hulu in November.\n        Back in 2018, Scorsese\u2019s contemporary and friend, Steven Spielberg, expressed misgivings about whether streaming movies merited full consideration for Oscars, telling ITV News, \u201cOnce you commit to a television format, you\u2019re a TV movie. I don\u2019t believe that films that are given token qualifications, in a couple of theaters for less than a week, should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.\u201d\n        Times have changed dramatically in that five-year span. Multiple streaming films have received best-picture nominations, and two of them, \u201cNomadland\u201d (Hulu) and \n            \n                \u201cCODA\u201d (Apple), won in 2021 and 2022, respectively. There were extenuating circumstances, but those movies overcame concerns about where and how they were seen.\n        Scorsese\u2019s initial point wasn\u2019t just a case of \u201cOld man yells at cloud,\u201d as some Marvel fans characterized it, and he needn\u2019t apologize for finding a way to keep making movies on his terms.\n        Yet his recent films have further contributed to erasing the bright lines he sought to draw around \u201ccinema,\u201d which have only become harder to distinguish as the kind of movies Scorsese champions undergo a transition in the light of a waning moon.\n  \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d premieres October 20 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.

Yet he appears to remain in denial about changes in the movie business that he loves, and the fact that with his last two films, \u201cThe Irishman\u201d and \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d he has graduated to directing what are, for all intents and purposes, limited series for streaming.\n  ", "body": "      Scorsese made headlines in 2019 when he stated in an interview that Marvel movies were \u201cnot cinema\u201d in terms of providing \u201caesthetic, emotional and spiritual revelation,\u201d as he later explained the idea in an op-ed for the New York Times. \n        The director also acknowledged in that article he understood the shift that had taken place, lamenting that multiplexes were \u201ccrowded with franchise pictures.\u201d While expressing gratitude that Netflix had allowed him to make \u201cThe Irishman\u201d the way he wanted to, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know a single filmmaker who doesn\u2019t want to design films for the big screen, to be projected before audiences in theaters.\u201d\n        Still, Scorsese is operating under an old set of rules governing Hollywood, including the one that says, to borrow from an even older adage, when you take the king\u2019s money, you give the king his due.\n        In this case, Scorsese has taken money from streaming service \u2013 first Netflix, now Apple TV+ \u2013 that allowed him to make 3 \u00bd-hour historical dramas that, let\u2019s face it, would have struggled to find enough theatrical patronage to justify the investment in our current times, the outlier of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d notwithstanding. For starters, any studio preoccupied with box office, as opposed to streaming, would have asked, if not insisted, that the 207-minute running time be cut substantially.\n        What that means, practically, is that after a wider and longer-than-usual theatrical run for awards consideration \u2013 the prestige from that being a primary factor in why Netflix and now Apple wrote those checks \u2013 \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d will be available on its platform (with a potential boost after nominations are announced) to consume at home.\n        Running roughly the length of a four-part limited series, most will watch the historical drama in that fashion with interruptions and bathroom breaks, just not those devised by the filmmaker.\n        Does that degrade or disparage these films in any way? Certainly not as entertainment, and arguably, the limited series has become a haven for some of the most creative storytelling put on screens, whatever their size, in the last decade.\n        What it does reflect is that Scorsese\u2019s view of what constitutes \u201ccinema\u201d has an outdated ring to it as many distinctions between TV and movies have evolved and indeed faded \u2013 a dynamic hastened by the twin phenomena of streaming and a global pandemic.\n        Other directors, notably, have embraced the unfettered time that streaming offers, from Zack Snyder\u2019s four-hour vision of \u201cJustice League\u201d to Baz Luhrmann\u2019s upcoming \u201cFaraway Downs,\u201d which expands and reimagines his 2008 movie \u201cAustralia,\u201d starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman, into a six-episode series with a different ending. The latter premieres on Hulu in November.\n        Back in 2018, Scorsese\u2019s contemporary and friend, Steven Spielberg, expressed misgivings about whether streaming movies merited full consideration for Oscars, telling ITV News, \u201cOnce you commit to a television format, you\u2019re a TV movie. I don\u2019t believe that films that are given token qualifications, in a couple of theaters for less than a week, should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.\u201d\n        Times have changed dramatically in that five-year span. Multiple streaming films have received best-picture nominations, and two of them, \u201cNomadland\u201d (Hulu) and \n            \n                \u201cCODA\u201d (Apple), won in 2021 and 2022, respectively. There were extenuating circumstances, but those movies overcame concerns about where and how they were seen.\n        Scorsese\u2019s initial point wasn\u2019t just a case of \u201cOld man yells at cloud,\u201d as some Marvel fans characterized it, and he needn\u2019t apologize for finding a way to keep making movies on his terms.\n        Yet his recent films have further contributed to erasing the bright lines he sought to draw around \u201ccinema,\u201d which have only become harder to distinguish as the kind of movies Scorsese champions undergo a transition in the light of a waning moon.\n  \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d premieres October 20 in US theaters. It\u2019s rated R.

I think it\u2019s a slippery slope,\u201d she said, adding that when it comes to religion, \u201cI\u2019m on the fence about it.\u201d\n        \u201cI\u2019m an actor, I\u2019m supposed to make the character I play believable, so that\u2019s a slippery slope for me, honestly,\u201d she said.\n        Speaking about her work with the Museum of Jewish Heritage, Margulies shared her passion for educating children about the Holocaust, an effort she believes is having an impact.\n        \u201cIt\u2019s working,\u201d Margulies said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached 7000 kids who knew nothing about Jews and the Holocaust.\u201d\n  ", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/entertainment/juliana-margulies-antisemitism/index.html", "section": "entertainment"}
